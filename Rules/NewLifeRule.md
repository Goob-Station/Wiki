# New Life Rule

What is new life rule?


<p id = "TheRule"> When you die, you don't remember who killed you. </p> 

## Death

When you die, you may not rememeber who killed you. You can remember who you are, you can remember where you were. But you forget the details that matters.

## Why?

This prevents players from ruining anothers round. 

When NLR wasn't around, often there was a pressure on antags to round remove or hide bodies, fearing they'd be snitched on. So we've opted to have NLR for LRP and MRP.

## How far can I push NLR?

If you died and woke up with extreme amnesia, you have all right to do that. It is your character. You must simply remember that you do not know how you died, or who killed you.
