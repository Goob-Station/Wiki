# New Life Rule

What is new life rule?


<p id = "TheRule"> When you die, you don't remember who killed you. </p> 

## Death

When you die, you may not rememeber who killed you. 

You can remember who you are, you can remember where you were. You may even remember what weapon was used to kill you(Being riddled with bullets often leads to you knowing you've been shot by a gun).

But you do not know who or what exactly killed you.

## Why?

This prevents players from ruining anothers round. 

When NLR wasn't around, often there was a pressure on antags to round remove or hide bodies, fearing they'd be snitched on. So we've opted to have NLR for LRP and MRP.

This can also be a fun. Remember this is just a game.

## How far can I push NLR?

If you died and woke up with extreme amnesia, you have all right to do that. It is your character. You must simply remember that you do not know exactly how you died, or who killed you.
