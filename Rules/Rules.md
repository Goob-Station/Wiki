# Main Rules - read these if nothing else

## 0. Enforcement of these rules is at the discretion of admins.

Roleplay is king, and admins can disregard other rules to this end should it prove beneficial for the experience of the shift. Admins are also allowed to intervene in rounds when it is in the best interest of the playerbase.

### Precedents
 Rule 0 should only be invoked by admins when it is in the best interests of the server.

  Admins have intervened before and will do so again in situations where a player, regardless of antag status:
  - Has repeatedly delayed round-end by recalling the shuttle when most other players are dead or want to leave.
  - Has habitually used the same strategies to cause mass death or destruction (i.e. bombs, hyper-optimized viruses, etc.) to the detriment of the rest of the server's experience.

  Admins may mirror bans from other servers at their discretion.

  Admins may ban accounts linked to the use of proxies, CID randomizers, DLL use, or other similar things, at their discretion.

  Admins may ask players in possession of multiple alt accounts to choose one to play on and ban the other accounts.

  If you regularly come close to breaking the rules without actually breaking them, it will be treated as the rules being broken.

  - Repeated instances of the same rules being broken may be met with harsher consequences. Baiting people into situations where you can report them to admins will be dealt with harshly.

## 1. Don't be a dick.

Be excellent to each other. If you enjoy trying to ruin someone elseâ€™s good time, you wonâ€™t have a place here. Being a jerk in-character is fine to a point, but being a jerk out of character is not welcome.
    
 ### Precedents
    
  - Do not facilitate player deaths for poor IC reasoning. Distributing bombs or other similarly destructive items can leave you responsible for how they are used if not cleared with an admin first. Each unjustified kill is normally met with a 24-hour ban.
  - Breaking into staffed departments to take resources, or hoarding station supplies with little IC reasoning can be harmful to the experience of other players. Communicate first if you desire something that you do not have access to. Players may defend their workplaces from trespassers who damage or steal property with relaxed escalation.
  - Unjustified grief/tiding, minor or otherwise, or unprovoked grief targeted towards players who wronged you in previous rounds ('metagrudging') can be followed up with notes, or bans.
  - If you do something that has no benefit to you other than making others upset and adminhelp the in-game consequences, you may be banned instead.
  - Spamming any channel is not allowed unless granted explicit permission from an admin as part of a gimmick.
  - Joining and exiting the round in an attempt to maximize antagonist rolls is not allowed.
  - Rules apply until the emergency escape shuttle is docked and the round-end antagonist report has appeared.

  ## Core Rule 2 - Do not use information gained outside of in-character means

  I.e. metagaming. This especially refers to communication between players outside of the game via things like Discord, known as metacomms. Characters are otherwise allowed to know everything about ingame mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent friendships or relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair advantage by teaming up together for little IC reason.

 ### Precedents
    
  - Metacomms, the use of methods of communication outside of SS14 IC, is a very serious rule violation and may be met with permanent bans for all related accounts. If players are sharing the same IP or know each other in real life or the like, inform the admins first, otherwise it may look suspicious. Players are allowed to introduce new players that they know to the game but all communication and explanations should be done in game if possible. Admins can also help in these situations if requested.
  - Streaming of the server is allowed. However if there's any indication that the stream is being used to metagame, such as a player watching the stream to gain information about the round, it will be treated as metacomms and dealt with accordingly.
  - Similar to how characters are allowed to know everything about in-game mechanics or antagonists under rule 2, characters are allowed to have persistent knowledge/relationships/friendships with the caveat that knowledge of a character being an antagonist from a previous round is not used maliciously.
  - Character friendships should not be exploitative in nature or be used to gain an unfair advantage. Having an IC friendship with another player does not, for example, justify giving them all-access each round.

 ## Core Rule 3 - This is a sandbox roleplaying server

  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  Keep IC out of OOC, and OOC out of IC. Your words and actions ingame should be distinguishable as an in-universe character, and not as a person playing a game. Playstyles that disregard all opportunities for engagement and roleplay can be met with administrative action. There is an exception for OOC in IC where terms like 'clickdrag X to Y, or look for the tab' is used to help a player.
	### Precedents
  - References to the current round, even if vague, are still considered being IC in OOC.
  - Disruptive fighting with your friends in public spaces (sometimes called "chicken fights" or "Family Guy chicken fighting") is against the rules if done so without valid IC reason. If you do want to fight your friends for no real IC reason, keep it out of the public or utilise purpose-built areas such as rage cages, boxing rings or holodeck combat sims to make it RP-friendly.
  - Make a minimum effort to have your name fit in a setting involving a wacky space station in the future.
  - Honorifics and nicknames are allowed as long as only one additive is used at a time, i.e "James Williams Jr." or "James "One-Eye" Williams". Excessively OOC names are disallowed, and are defined as names which are intentionally hard to read/spell, references to in-game mechanics or OOC terminology, historical/famous/media, and any form of nonsensical or low-effort name. Clowns, mimes, silicons, wizards, and nuke ops have significantly more leeway in choosing their names, within reason.

 ## Core Rule 4 - Lone antagonists are unbound by (most) rules

  With the exception of metagaming/comms, bug/exploit abuse, erotic/creepy stuff, OOC in IC or IC in OOC, or spawn-camping arrivals, solo antagonists may pursue any goals they wish, in any way they wish.And no, this does not mean you get to mass sabotage John Shitter. Look at (link to gameplay rules) for a better understanding but escalation and roleplay is key.

  To put it in simple terms, if you put the effort into your roleplay, then you can escalate to your hearts content.

  Crewmembers are not allowed to pre-emptively search for, hinder, or otherwise seek conflict with antagonists without reasonable cause to do so. Otherwise, they may handle antagonists in any way they wish, provided they understand that their actions may be punished by Space Law if given IC cause. Team antagonists can do as they wish as per lone antagonists, but their actions should neither harm their teams efforts, nor intentionally harm it through inaction. Emulating an antagonist by action or outfit puts you at risk of being treated as one.
	### Precedents
  - Regular crewmembers can assist antagonists with good IC reasoning, but assisting an antagonist doesn't mean you get a pass on acting like one. If in doubt, ask an admin if a particular action is okay. Depending on the level of assistance, sufficient IC reasoning ranges from treating everyone who goes into medbay regardless of their history, to bartering contraband, to performing actions under threat of death.
  - Ghosting out mid-conversion/deconversion, going AFK, suiciding, or logging off after conversion/deconversion can result administrative action if done in bad faith. Let an admin know if you cannot or do not want to play any of the above mentioned roles so they may be offered to a willing participant.

  ### Antagonist Directive Priorities
  - In situations where you wind up with multiple simultaneous antagonist assignments (i.e. a Revolutionary and a Traitor), your team goals, objectives, and directives should take precedence. Furthermore, if someone had to go out of their way to convert you to their team, their goals, objectives, and directives become the priority. Refer to the following flowchart:
  - Blob/Zombie -> Brainwash/Construct orders/Silicon Laws -> Cult/Heretic -> Revs -> Wizard Apprentice/Abductor Teams/Niche antags -> Nuke Ops -> Traitors

## Core Rule 5 - Players in vital job roles require a minimum amount of effort

  As a Head of Staff, you should be a reliable worker for your department, and are expected to perform the minimum duties of that role to the best of your ability. As an upside, being THE BOSS allows you to dictate the workflow of your department as you like, so long as you are reasonable - and have the ability to demote staff who do not comply, with similar protections that security is afforded for valid arrests.

  Notify admins if you must leave near round start for Command or AI roles.

  A reasonable effort should always be made to put yourself in cryosleep to open up your job slot.
    
## Core Rule 6 - In-game administration rulings are final

  Incidences of admin abuse, negligence or disputed rulings can be taken to the Discord server. If an admin says something was 'looked into, handled, resolved' etc, regarding an issue, it is unlikely an admin will provide any further information. Admins are under no obligation to reveal IC information. Deliberately lying or misrepresenting facts in adminhelps will be dealt with harshly.

  Almost all bans may be appealed on our forums at discord.gg/goobstation in the ban appeals section. This is generally the only acceptable way to contact the administration team to discuss your ban and revise it if inappropriate, including mistaken bans.

  Any attempt to circumvent or bypass a game ban will result in a voucher ban. Attempting to evade role bans by gaining access to or working in the capacity of a job you are banned from will result in a game ban. These bans are applied even if the evasion attempt is unsuccessful.

  ### Exceptions
  There are no exemptions for evading or attempting to evade game bans. Antagonists who impersonate or take over a role which they are banned from to aid in their goals are not considered to be evading their role ban.

  ### Additional Information
  - https://docs.goobstation.com/en/community/admin/goob-station-banning-policy.html

  ### Precedents
  - Incidents of admin abuse or negligence should be reported along with a date and time, along with details to pinpoint the incident in the logs, to any full admin via forum PM or posted on the admin complaints sub-forum located at https://discord.gg/goobstation. Incidents of poorly conducted admin events may also be taken to https://discord.gg/goobstation in their respective feedback threads, for less serious complaints.
  - Lying in adminhelps, misrepresenting facts deliberately, or logging off when an admin has asked a question may result in permabans. Admins will not automatically place bans for players logging off however, and will generally wait a while in case real life situations caused a player to disconnect or go AFK.

 ## Core Rule 7 - Only use English
  Only English is permitted, both in-character and out-of-character. You must be fluent in English enough to be able to not cause game issues, and to be able to communicate with game admins when necessary. If a game admin does not feel that you are fluent enough in English, they may ban you.

  ### Why
  We do not have enough staff fluent in other languages to moderate them. Translation tools can be unreliable and are not integrated well into the game.

  ### Non-English Options
  There are many servers that allow or focus on other languages. You are highly encouraged to play only on servers that allow languages you are fluent in.

  ## Core Rule 8 - Erotic/creepy stuff is not allowed

  No form of erotic roleplay is allowed on the servers, including things that could be construed as sexual by unwilling participants.

## Core Rule 9 - Players need to be the age of 16 or above

  This rule is for the benefit of and is meant to protect people who shouldn't be playing here due to the nature of the SS14 community. Your age won't be hunted down, but if you admit it to us in admin PMs, or other places within our community, you will be removed.
    
    
## Core Rule 10 - Losing is part of the game

  Your character will frequently die, sometimes without even a possibility of avoiding it. Events will often be out of your control. No matter how good or prepared you are, sometimes you just lose.
    
## Core Rule 11 - Bigotry is not allowed.

  Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, disability, orientation or the like is not tolerated.

  ### Precedents
- This rule applies to ALL OOC bigotry, even when expressed in IC. There is no racism in 2565, just species-ism: there is no homophobia, just xenophiliaphobia, etc.
 - Admins are encouraged to use rule 1 to deal with instances where """IC""" bigotry is excessive or designed as a mask for OOC bigotry.
  - Context is important, but somebody being an out and proud bigot, nazi, or white supremacist also counts as context. Somebody who makes it known they are bigoted towards PoCs playing a PoC character that starts checking stereotype boxes isn't going to fool us.
  - Obvious or common real life replacements of offensive words or slurs used in IC are not allowed. For example, you may not insult a lizard by calling them the L- and ending with er as an N-word derivative will result in your permanent removal. Be creative.

  ## Core Rule 13 - Use realistic character names, and do not use names of famous people
  - No names of people or characters fictional or real from our world. You are not slick if you switch a few letters around.
  - No titles/honorifics (Exceptions being generational titles like "Jr" or "I", "II", "III", etc), nicknames, or shortenings. Use proper capitalization (e.g. NOT J Hoffman or jaiden mallow).
  - Must follow all other rules (no slurs/sexual names/etc)
  - Usernames, objects, random characters, very "low effort" names, "meta" names, or otherwise implausible names cannot be used as names. See examples below.
  - Admin rulings on IC names are final and disputes should be done through the forums, not by refusing to comply with an admin
  - Species have naming conventions that are part of their in-universe culture. These may be subverted if they have sufficient in-character reasoning and effort to explain their non-standard name. Non-standard names are held to higher scrutiny and you may be questioned on why your name breaks these conventions.

  ## Naming Conventions:
  Clowns and mimes are exempt from the prohibition on titles/honorifics and have loosened restrictions on low-effort and implausible names.

  ### Clarification on "Meta" Names
  Meta names attempt to take advantage of some game mechanic or game design choice. "Urist McHands" is a meta name because it is the default name for admin-spawned humans. "Operator Whiskey" is a meta name because it follows the naming pattern of nuclear operatives. This rule is not intended to prevent things like nuclear operatives using a fake ID with names that appear to be nuclear operative names if they decide that they want to do that.

  ### Conventions and Examples

  Any name considered Good: can be used for the species it falls under. Any names considered Bad: cannot be used for that specie or any other species.

  Humans, Slimes, Dwarves, Vulpkanins, and Harpies should use the Firstname Lastname convention.

  Examples
  - Good: Tom Fisher
  - Good: Spacey Chapman
  - Good: Aaron Rikes
  - Bad: Dr. Tom Fisher
  - Bad: Walter White
  - Bad: George Washington
  - Bad: Joe Biden
  - Bad: Ben Dover
  - Bad: Mike Hunt
  - Bad: Joe Mamma


  Reptilians should use the "verb-article-noun" or Argonian convention.

  Examples
  - Good: Cleans-the-Airlocks
  - Good: Deekus
  - Good: Deetum-Ja
  - Good: Artemis
  - Good: Rolls-the-Dice
  - Good:Mops-The-Floors
  - Good:Shira-Thaskan
  - Bad: Bans-the-Admins

  Diona should have calm, nature-themed, Noun of Noun style names.

  Examples
  - Good: Petal of Tranquility
  - Good: Garden of Relaxation
  - Bad: Tree but Alive

  Mothmen should use Latin sounding names, light themed names or a moniker usually related to something the person likes or is known for.

  Examples
  - Good: Socrates Temnora
  - Good: Sierra Lightseeker
  - Good: James Nightflitter
  - Good: Tulip


  Arachnids should have Latin-sounding names.

  Examples
  - Good: Argyroneta Reticulatus
  - Good: Loxosceles Domesticus
  - Bad: Spider-Man

  Vox use a single name made of random syllables, often with repeating patterns.
  Names should not be excessively long or be so repetitive/convoluted as to be unreadable.

  Examples
  - Good: Hirixashahre
  - Good: Xapikrikrik
  - Bad: Chipikirchitchitchitbecretretrer
  - Bad: Trololol


  Rodentia naming convention has the first name an descriptor (Strong, Big-eyed, Trash-eating) and the "first" part either being a simple first name or pet name (Monty, Basil, Nibbles). Rondentia names can also simply be a single pet name.

  Examples
  - Good: Big Poppy
  - Good: Fast-paws Lily
  - Good: Strong Peanut
  - Good: Big-eyed Basil
  - Good: Rose

  Yowies have a single word first name from aboriginal or australian culture

  Examples
  - Good: Mulya
  - Good: Bilal
  - Good: Lachlan
  - Good: Chase
  - Bad: Sassy the Sasquatch
  - Bad: Bigfoot
  - Bad: Mr Hairy

  Tajaran names consist of first name and last name. They're usually difficult to pronounce and are made up of syllabes such as "raj", "tajr", "hrar" or "khaz". Both first and last name follow this convention, but last names "Hadii" "Kaytam" "Zhan-Khazan" "Hharar" "Njarir'Akhan" should generally be preferred. First and last name can be seperated by apostrophe (') instead of space.

  Examples
  - Good: Rrjunjurlazu Aravah
  - Good: Baqka Jrirhe
  - Good: Jurlfar'Kaytam
  - Good: Ii'rvahmiran Njarir'Akhan
  - Bad: Hrhrahrhr Krkrakrkr
  - Bad: Kitty McCat
  - Bad: Khajit

  Usernames, objects, random characters, very "low effort" names, "meta" names, or otherwise implausible names are not permitted.

  Examples
  - Bad: XxRobustxX
  - Bad: SDpksSodjdfk
  - Bad: Lkdsoisgoieun
  - Bad: F4ith H3arth
  - Bad: Greytide
  - Bad: Passenger

    <h1>Roleplay Rules</h1>
    <p>
 # Roleplay Rule 1 - LRP and MRP have different levels of intended roleplay

  The purpose of roleplay servers are to provide a higher quality environment for roleplay. The roleplay rules are intended to promote more interactions between players so more roleplay moments can happen. They are not exhaustive, and admins have a very broad discretion to intervene where behaviours or actions could, if left ignored, contribute to a lower roleplay environment.

  What differentiates LRP and MRP on Goob is generally community driven and not strictly defined. However, please note the following:

  - LRP is intended to be a more casual roleplay environment, where players are not expected to follow the same level of immersion or character consistency as in MRP.
  - MRP is intended to be a more immersive roleplay environment, where players are expected to follow a higher level of immersion and character consistency.
  - The average round time on LRP is generally shorter than on MRP, and players are expected to be more flexible with their characters and roleplay.
  - A character on LRP is not expected to be as fleshed out or consistent as a character on MRP, and players are encouraged to have fun and experiment with their characters.
  - antagonists on LRP are not expected to follow the same level of immersion or character consistency as on MRP, and players are encouraged to have fun and experiment with their antagonists.
  - On MRP antagonists are expected to follow a higher level of immersion and character consistency, and players are encouraged to have fun and experiment with their antagonists within the boundaries of the roleplay rules.
      
   # Roleplay Rule 2 - Escalation and roleplay.
  Modified standard escalation applies to instances of player conflict. Players may escalate as per standard escalation policy on LRP/MRP where they have legitimate in character reason to do so.

  Players acting without legitimate IC reasoning (for example: randomly or unnecessarily attempting to steal items from departments or other people) void the right to escalate to lethal self-defence if it is employed reasonably by the wronged party.

  - Higher effort in roleplay allows you to escalate more.
  - If you are attacked, you may defend yourself with lethal force if you have a legitimate IC reason to do so.
  - MRP players are expected to follow a higher level of immersion and character consistency, and players are encouraged to have fun and experiment with their antagonists within the boundaries of the roleplay rules.
   
     # Roleplay Rule 3 - Chain of command and security are important.

  If you're in the Chain of Command or in Security, you're expected to put in the effort and do your job as a departmental leader.

  If you're not in the Chain of Command, your department head is your boss and they can fire you. Security officers can arrest you for stealing or breaking into places. Demotions and short brig sentences for actions that would get you fired or arrested in real life are roleplay opportunities.

  ## precedents

  - The internal chain of command for security is Head of Security > Warden > Officers & Detective.
  - Security are expected by default to follow the orders of their superiors, especially when determining the punishment of those you apprehend. When determining severe punishments such as permanent incarceration or execution, make an effort to contact a superior if the situation permits it.
  - You are allowed to disobey a superior's order with appropriate in-character roleplay reasoning. Complete disregard for the chain of command as a member of security is not tolerated.
      
        # Roleplay Rule 4 - Do not metagame, obey the Metashield
  Something that is "shielded" cannot be known by your character during a round until the "revealing condition" happens. This also means that your character cannot do things based on "shielded" information. Knowing or acting on something that is shielded before the revealing condition is met is referred to as metagaming.

  Revealing conditions reveal the shielded information for the round, not for a specific instance. This means that once a revealing condition is met in a round, the shield no longer applies in any case for the remainder of the round.

  ## Never Revealed IC
  Some shields are never revealed IC. This means that your character can never act as if they know about that shielded thing.

  The following are shielded:
  - Current game mode and possible antags during the current game mode.
  - Events from previous rounds.
  - Events you experienced as a different character.
  - All information related to the player of a character rather than the character itself. (See "Metafriending and Metagrudging" below.)
  - All information gained while dead or a ghost.
  - All information gained while in critical condition or unconscious.
  - The fact that a round will end.

  This does not prevent knowing that a shift will end, but does prohibit things like preparing to kill people at central command when roleplay rules stop being enforced on LRP.

  ## Nuclear Operatives

  - Nuclear Operatives are rumoured but not proven. Have fun with this rumour.

  ## Changelings

  - In the eyes of the public, changelings are an exterminated predatory lifeform, they could always come back, but they'd not be on our station, right?

  ## Heretics

  - The chaplain is aware of the existence of heretics, but the chaplain is always spewing nonsense. What do they even mean?

  ## Cosmic Cult

  - The chaplain is saying words again! Why do they hire such weird people?

  ## Devils

  - The chaplain is now...talking about DEVILS? What is this nonsense? Devils are just a myth, right? They can't be real!

  Knowledge about the abilities and consequences of a Devil deal are not shielded.

  ## Zombies

  Zombies are known galaxy-wide, but not as real-life, instead, as fiction.
  Nuclear Operatives and Syndicate Agents are aware of Romerol and what it can do, but there's no benefit to revealing it to the crew. People likely won't believe you anyway.

  ## Infections(Once the zombie virus is proven)

  Such infections have been known to be extinct. But luckily advanced medicine has been able to cure the infection. The cure is not known to the public, but it is known to Chemists and Chief Medical Officers. The cure is not known to be a cure for the zombie virus, but it is known to be a cure for an infection that causes people to become zombies.

  ## Deathsquad

  Deathsquad is a sci-fi trope that is well known in the galaxy, but not as a real thing. It is a myth, a legend, and a story that people tell each other. The Deathsquad is not real, but some will argue that it is.

  ## Implanted implants

  Implants are not shielded by default, but the fact that they are not Nanotrasen (NT) implants is shielded.

  ## Chameleon Items

  Chameleon items are shielded.
  Being suspicious of an item being fake or stolen is not shielded, but testing items or calling them chameleon is covered by this shield.

  ## Stealth Items

  The fact that an item can be something other than what its visual appearance and examine description indicate is shielded.
  Security may be aware of tampered items, but they are not aware of the specific item that is tamped. This means that security may not act on the fact that an item is tamped, but they may act on the fact that an item is suspicious.  (Example: Non-NT weapons on a persons is suspicious, how did they get it on station?)
  This shield protects stealth items, including protecting them from being tested.


  ## Metafriending and Metagrudging
  This section provides additional information on a concept that is prohibited by multiple metashield items that are never revealed IC. Giving a person or character preferential treatment based on something that your character should not know is considered metafriending. Treating a person or character negatively based on something that your character should not know is considered metagrudging.

  ## Metafriending Examples
  These are all examples of things that are prohibited by at least one metashield item that is never revealed IC.
  - Giving a character additional access or a job because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Trusting a character because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Not fighting a character because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Ignoring your objective to kill a character because your character and theirs became friends in a previous round.

  ## Metagrudging Examples
  These are all examples of things that are prohibited by at least one metashield item that is never revealed IC.
  - Not giving a character additional access or a job because you are mad at or don't like the player who is playing that character.
  - Not trusting a character because you are mad at or don't like the player who is playing that character.
  - Starting a fight with a character because of something that they did last round.
  - Starting a fight with a character because they killed you while you were playing a different character.
  - Targeting or harassing a character based on anything which that character did outside the current round.
  - Targeting or harassing a character based on anything which the character's player did while not playing the character.

  ## Explicitly Not Shielded
  The following is a list of things that are explicitly not shielded. If something is not on this list, it doesn't mean that it is shielded, but if something is on it then it definitely is not shielded.
  - The fact that the nuke disk must be protected and could be used by a bad actor to try to destroy the station.
  - Items that are of high value or are desired by the Syndicate, and therefore are likely targets of theft.
  - The idea that any Syndicate agent or other bad actor has goals or objectives that they are attempting to accomplish.
  - The number of goals or objectives that a Syndicate agent or other bad actor has.
  - The fact that the Syndicate are enemies of Nanotrasen, and that they regularly attempt to send covert agents to spy on, sabotage, or attack Nanotrasen.
  - A character's typical appearance. Though you should keep in mind that multiple characters can share the same name.
  - The fact that the Syndicate have covert items capable of getting items to them, and that these items are known as uplinks.
  - Wizards are not metashielded as the wizards federation is well rumoured about.

  For revealing conditions check out [textlink="Antag revealing conditions" link="Conditions"]
      
       # Roleplay Rule 5 - Non-security may only actively hunt global or round-ending threats.
  You should not act like a vigilante if a security force is present unless you have a good in-character roleplay reason to believe a global or round-ending threat exists. Restricted antags that are not automatically global or round ending threats may still become so through their actions in the shift, the stronger your reasoning the more action you can take against them.

  You can always defend yourself and others from violent antagonists.

  Players that choose to act as security will be held to the same standards as security.

  ## Precedents

  - Actively hunting a threat involves seeking out or pursuing that threat outside the bounds of your normal reasonable play area. Players are not expected to ignore antagonists during the normal course of play and may engage with antagonists who are active within their sphere. (Examples: A medical doctor knowing the identity of an active traitor could attack that traitor if that traitor came armed into medbay, likewise an engineer could attack a traitor they spotted breaking into the engine room). Players choosing this route should not attempt to chase down or finish antagonists who retreat from these engagements (unless they have reason to believe that the antagonist constitutes a global or round-ending threat or have a personal reason to do so under other precedents)
  - The dead dog litmus test: Players may hunt specific threats or antagonists who have identifiably done something to wrong that particular player, the Ur-example being that players may seek revenge against those who harm their departmental pets. Players who choose this path are empowered to act as security in regard to that specific threat, but as per the main rule must also follow related restrictions on security play. This can also be applied to an assault of a character you've had significant interactions with, in the current round, and it does not apply to cross-round or OOC friendships.
  - Security are freely empowered to deputise players as they will or to declare states of emergency if they believe themselves unable to handle ongoing issues within the round. These calls should be backed up by the chain of command where possible, and non-security players are free to enquire with security to see if they require assistance if concerned. As per the main rule, deputized players are acting as security and held to securityâ€™s standards. (Players consistently asking to be deputized or doing so with little in-character reasoning may be asked to knock it off and just play security)

       # Roleplay Rule 6 - Antagonism and roleplaying as an antagonist..

  The goal of antagonists is to create stories and make rounds interesting, for both antagonist players and crew-sided players alike. Antagonists are expected to put in at least some effort towards playing their designated role, though may break with it given sufficient in character reason. Some antagonists are restricted in the ways and quantities they may lend themselves to visiting death and destruction upon the crew.

  ## Precedents
  - Objectives are suggestions, and antagonists are free to ignore them if they have a preferred or more interesting idea for their course of action.
  - Actions as an antagonist do not have to be nefarious or evil, but should make an effort to influence the story and meaningfully impact the shift. Explicitly friendly antagonistic play or siding outright with the crew is restricted â€“ players must have good in-character reasoning behind the decision or an antagonistic goal in mind by doing it.
  - Roleplay rule 11 applies to the actions of antagonists â€“ extremely repetitive antagonistic actions repeated over the long term may draw an administrative request to tone it down or try something new, if most of the people on the server can immediately guess what youâ€™re going to do when made an antagonist, it might be time to come up with a new plan.

  ## important information regarding antag labels.
  - Traitors and Changelings may team despite being solo antagonists, but risk being a target themselves or double crossed for their biomass or TC.
  - Heretics do not team, they are explicitly solo antagonists, heretics have conflicting ideologies. This puts them at odds with each other. The stronger god wins.
  - Bingles are only interested in feeding the hole. You must feed the hole.
  - While the abductor may steal anything, it is generally only interested in research. Some trinkets are cool to collect but what use are these normal items?
  
  # Restricted Antag Death and Destruction

  ## With Objectives
  Antagonist objectives are the core of what antagonists are allowed to directly do with no or limited roleplay reasoning. Actions taken to directly accomplish an objective do not have to be proportionate.

  Causing death and destruction to help with indirectly accomplishing objectives must have an in-character roleplay reason. If questioned about a chain of events involving indirect actions, the antagonist should be able to clearly explain what events in the current shift led them to their course of action without resorting to hypotheticals.

  If a player or department directly interferes with the completion of an objective, this is no longer a hypothetical as the antagonist can now point to specific events in the shift to justify their actions.

  ## Without Objectives

  When wanting to cause death and destruction not related to objectives, restricted antagonists may instead rely on extremely relaxed escalation.

  They may escalate lethally sooner and with less justification, may use more lethal methods to escalate and may rely on antagonistic reasons for escalating. Such reasons may include escalating against people who are excessively polite or helpful as well as being mean or rude, escalating against groups of people who exclude them or escalating against people who ignore or avoid attempts to communicate entirely.

  They have no obligation to treat their victims but escalating over minor issues should not result in the antagonist taking steps to permanently round-remove the other player unless escalation policy would otherwise permit it.

  ## Mass Sabotage Exception

  There exist some antagonistic actions which are so indiscriminate that they can never form justification for directly accomplishing an objective, but are also so disproportionate that no IC reason can allow for using them to indirectly accomplish an objective. This has the potential to make dangerous areas of the station safer than intended, because the crew know common antagonists can't take full advantage of those spaces in dangerous or deadly ways.

  To avoid this, mass station sabotage that is likely to kill people is allowed so long as the antagonist does not take any direct and specific personal actions to maximise the bodycount beyond what the sabotage itself causes.

  The test for mass station sabotage is to consider only strategies that a restricted antagonist could never justify using to complete a standard kill objective. Examples include plasma flooding, causing a supermatter delamination and spacing the station, although this list is not exhaustive. An example of a strategy which does not fall under mass station sabotage would be uses of bombs or other explosives, which can form justification for completing a standard kill objective and follow those rules instead.
