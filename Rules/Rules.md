# Main Rules - read these if nothing else

## 0. Enforcement of these rules is at the discretion of admins.

Roleplay is king, and admins can disregard other rules to this end should it prove beneficial for the experience of the shift. Admins are also allowed to intervene in rounds when it is in the best interest of the playerbase.

Rule 0 Precedents.

## 1. Don't be a dick.

Be excellent to each other. If you enjoy trying to ruin someone elseâ€™s good time, you wonâ€™t have a place here. Being a jerk in-character is fine to a point, but being a jerk out of character is not welcome.

## 2. Do not use information gained outside of in-character means. I.e. metagaming.

This especially refers to communication between players outside of the game via things like Discord, known as metacomms. Characters are otherwise allowed to know everything about ingame mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent friendships or relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair advantage by teaming up together for little IC reason. 

Rule 2 Precedents. 

## 3. This is a sandbox roleplaying server 

Keep IC out of OOC, and OOC out of IC. Your words and actions ingame should be distinguishable as an in-universe character, and not as a person playing a game. Playstyles that disregard all opportunities for engagement and roleplay can be met with administrative action. There is an exception for OOC in IC where terms like 'clickdrag X to Y, or look for the tab' is used to help a player. 

Rule 3 Precedents. 

## 4. Lone antagonists are unbound by (most) rules 

With the exception of metagaming/comms, bug/exploit abuse, erotic/creepy stuff, OOC in IC or IC in OOC, or spawn-camping arrivals, solo antagonists may pursue any goals they wish, in any way they wish.And no, this does not mean you get to mass sabotage John Shitter. Look at (link to gameplay rules) for a better understanding but escalation and roleplay is key. To put it in simple terms, if you put the effort into your roleplay, then you can escalate to your hearts content. Crewmembers are not allowed to pre-emptively search for, hinder, or otherwise seek conflict with antagonists without reasonable cause to do so. Otherwise, they may handle antagonists in any way they wish, provided they understand that their actions may be punished by Space Law if given IC cause. Team antagonists can do as they wish as per lone antagonists, but their actions should neither harm their teams efforts, nor intentionally harm it through inaction. Emulating an antagonist by action or outfit puts you at risk of being treated as one. Rule 4 Precedents. Order of antagonist priority. 

## 5. Players in vital job roles require a minimum amount of effort

As a Head of Staff, you should be a reliable worker for your department, and are expected to perform the minimum duties of that role to the best of your ability. As an upside, being THE BOSS allows you to dictate the workflow of your department as you like, so long as you are reasonable - and have the ability to demote staff who do not comply, with similar protections that security is afforded for valid arrests. Notify admins if you must leave near round start for Command or AI roles. A reasonable effort should always be made to put yourself in cryosleep to open up your job slot. 

## 6. In-game administration rulings are final

Incidences of admin abuse, negligence or disputed rulings can be taken to the Discord server. If an admin says something was 'looked into, handled, resolved' etc, regarding an issue, it is unlikely an admin will provide any further information. Admins are under no obligation to reveal IC information. Deliberately lying or misrepresenting facts in adminhelps will be dealt with harshly. 
    
Rule 6 Precedents. 
    
## 7. If you regularly come close to breaking the rules without actually breaking them, it will be treated as the rules being broken. 
    
Repeated instances of the same rules being broken may be met with harsher consequences. Baiting people into situations where you can report them to admins will be dealt with harshly. 
    
    
## (A)8. Erotic/creepy stuff is not allowed. 
    
No form of erotic roleplay is allowed on the servers, including things that could be construed as sexual by unwilling participants. 
    
Rule 8 Precedents. 
    
## 9. Players need to be the age of 16 or above. 
    
This rule is for the benefit of and is meant to protect people who shouldn't be playing here due to the nature of the SS14 community. Your age won't be hunted down, but if you admit it to us in admin PMs, or other places within our community, you will be removed. 

## 10. Losing is part of the game.
    
Your character will frequently die, sometimes without even a possibility of avoiding it. Events will often be out of your control. No matter how good or prepared you are, sometimes you just lose. 
    
## 11. Bigotry is not allowed. 
    
Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, disability, orientation or the like is not tolerated. 
    
Rule 11 Precedents.
