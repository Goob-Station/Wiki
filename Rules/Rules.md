# Main Rules - read these if nothing else

## 0. Enforcement of these rules is at the discretion of admins.

Roleplay is king, and admins can disregard other rules to this end should it prove beneficial for the experience of the shift. Admins are also allowed to intervene in rounds when it is in the best interest of the playerbase.

### Precedents
 Rule 0 should only be invoked by admins when it is in the best interests of the server.

  Admins have intervened before and will do so again in situations where a player, regardless of antag status:
  - Has repeatedly delayed round-end by recalling the shuttle when most other players are dead or want to leave.
  - Has habitually used the same strategies to cause mass death or destruction (i.e. bombs, hyper-optimized viruses, etc.) to the detriment of the rest of the server's experience.

  Admins may mirror bans from other servers at their discretion.

  Admins may ban accounts linked to the use of proxies, CID randomizers, DLL use, or other similar things, at their discretion.

  Admins may ask players in possession of multiple alt accounts to choose one to play on and ban the other accounts.

  If you regularly come close to breaking the rules without actually breaking them, it will be treated as the rules being broken.

  - Repeated instances of the same rules being broken may be met with harsher consequences. Baiting people into situations where you can report them to admins will be dealt with harshly.

## 1. Don't be a dick.

Be excellent to each other. If you enjoy trying to ruin someone elseâ€™s good time, you wonâ€™t have a place here. Being a jerk in-character is fine to a point, but being a jerk out of character is not welcome.
    
 ### Precedents
    
  - Do not facilitate player deaths for poor IC reasoning. Distributing bombs or other similarly destructive items can leave you responsible for how they are used if not cleared with an admin first. Each unjustified kill is normally met with a 24-hour ban.
  - Breaking into staffed departments to take resources, or hoarding station supplies with little IC reasoning can be harmful to the experience of other players. Communicate first if you desire something that you do not have access to. Players may defend their workplaces from trespassers who damage or steal property with relaxed escalation.
  - Unjustified grief/tiding, minor or otherwise, or unprovoked grief targeted towards players who wronged you in previous rounds ('metagrudging') can be followed up with notes, or bans.
  - If you do something that has no benefit to you other than making others upset and adminhelp the in-game consequences, you may be banned instead.
  - Spamming any channel is not allowed unless granted explicit permission from an admin as part of a gimmick.
  - Joining and exiting the round in an attempt to maximize antagonist rolls is not allowed.
  - Rules apply until the emergency escape shuttle is docked and the round-end antagonist report has appeared.

  ## Core Rule 2 - Do not use information gained outside of in-character means

  I.e. metagaming. This especially refers to communication between players outside of the game via things like Discord, known as metacomms. Characters are otherwise allowed to know everything about ingame mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent friendships or relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair advantage by teaming up together for little IC reason.

 ### Precedents
    
  - Metacomms, the use of methods of communication outside of SS14 IC, is a very serious rule violation and may be met with permanent bans for all related accounts. If players are sharing the same IP or know each other in real life or the like, inform the admins first, otherwise it may look suspicious. Players are allowed to introduce new players that they know to the game but all communication and explanations should be done in game if possible. Admins can also help in these situations if requested.
  - Streaming of the server is allowed. However if there's any indication that the stream is being used to metagame, such as a player watching the stream to gain information about the round, it will be treated as metacomms and dealt with accordingly.
  - Similar to how characters are allowed to know everything about in-game mechanics or antagonists under rule 2, characters are allowed to have persistent knowledge/relationships/friendships with the caveat that knowledge of a character being an antagonist from a previous round is not used maliciously.
  - Character friendships should not be exploitative in nature or be used to gain an unfair advantage. Having an IC friendship with another player does not, for example, justify giving them all-access each round.

 ## Core Rule 3 - This is a sandbox roleplaying server

  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  Keep IC out of OOC, and OOC out of IC. Your words and actions ingame should be distinguishable as an in-universe character, and not as a person playing a game. Playstyles that disregard all opportunities for engagement and roleplay can be met with administrative action. There is an exception for OOC in IC where terms like 'clickdrag X to Y, or look for the tab' is used to help a player.
	### Precedents
  - References to the current round, even if vague, are still considered being IC in OOC.
  - Disruptive fighting with your friends in public spaces (sometimes called "chicken fights" or "Family Guy chicken fighting") is against the rules if done so without valid IC reason. If you do want to fight your friends for no real IC reason, keep it out of the public or utilise purpose-built areas such as rage cages, boxing rings or holodeck combat sims to make it RP-friendly.
  - Make a minimum effort to have your name fit in a setting involving a wacky space station in the future.
  - Honorifics and nicknames are allowed as long as only one additive is used at a time, i.e "James Williams Jr." or "James "One-Eye" Williams". Excessively OOC names are disallowed, and are defined as names which are intentionally hard to read/spell, references to in-game mechanics or OOC terminology, historical/famous/media, and any form of nonsensical or low-effort name. Clowns, mimes, silicons, wizards, and nuke ops have significantly more leeway in choosing their names, within reason.

 ## Core Rule 4 - Lone antagonists are unbound by (most) rules

  With the exception of metagaming/comms, bug/exploit abuse, erotic/creepy stuff, OOC in IC or IC in OOC, or spawn-camping arrivals, solo antagonists may pursue any goals they wish, in any way they wish.And no, this does not mean you get to mass sabotage John Shitter. Look at (link to gameplay rules) for a better understanding but escalation and roleplay is key.

  To put it in simple terms, if you put the effort into your roleplay, then you can escalate to your hearts content.

  Crewmembers are not allowed to pre-emptively search for, hinder, or otherwise seek conflict with antagonists without reasonable cause to do so. Otherwise, they may handle antagonists in any way they wish, provided they understand that their actions may be punished by Space Law if given IC cause. Team antagonists can do as they wish as per lone antagonists, but their actions should neither harm their teams efforts, nor intentionally harm it through inaction. Emulating an antagonist by action or outfit puts you at risk of being treated as one.
	### Precedents
  - Regular crewmembers can assist antagonists with good IC reasoning, but assisting an antagonist doesn't mean you get a pass on acting like one. If in doubt, ask an admin if a particular action is okay. Depending on the level of assistance, sufficient IC reasoning ranges from treating everyone who goes into medbay regardless of their history, to bartering contraband, to performing actions under threat of death.
  - Ghosting out mid-conversion/deconversion, going AFK, suiciding, or logging off after conversion/deconversion can result administrative action if done in bad faith. Let an admin know if you cannot or do not want to play any of the above mentioned roles so they may be offered to a willing participant.

  ### Antagonist Directive Priorities
  - In situations where you wind up with multiple simultaneous antagonist assignments (i.e. a Revolutionary and a Traitor), your team goals, objectives, and directives should take precedence. Furthermore, if someone had to go out of their way to convert you to their team, their goals, objectives, and directives become the priority. Refer to the following flowchart:
  - Blob/Zombie -> Brainwash/Construct orders/Silicon Laws -> Cult/Heretic -> Revs -> Wizard Apprentice/Abductor Teams/Niche antags -> Nuke Ops -> Traitors

## Core Rule 5 - Players in vital job roles require a minimum amount of effort

  As a Head of Staff, you should be a reliable worker for your department, and are expected to perform the minimum duties of that role to the best of your ability. As an upside, being THE BOSS allows you to dictate the workflow of your department as you like, so long as you are reasonable - and have the ability to demote staff who do not comply, with similar protections that security is afforded for valid arrests.

  Notify admins if you must leave near round start for Command or AI roles.

  A reasonable effort should always be made to put yourself in cryosleep to open up your job slot.
    
## Core Rule 6 - In-game administration rulings are final

  Incidences of admin abuse, negligence or disputed rulings can be taken to the Discord server. If an admin says something was 'looked into, handled, resolved' etc, regarding an issue, it is unlikely an admin will provide any further information. Admins are under no obligation to reveal IC information. Deliberately lying or misrepresenting facts in adminhelps will be dealt with harshly.

  Almost all bans may be appealed on our forums at discord.gg/goobstation in the ban appeals section. This is generally the only acceptable way to contact the administration team to discuss your ban and revise it if inappropriate, including mistaken bans.

  Any attempt to circumvent or bypass a game ban will result in a voucher ban. Attempting to evade role bans by gaining access to or working in the capacity of a job you are banned from will result in a game ban. These bans are applied even if the evasion attempt is unsuccessful.

  ### Exceptions
  There are no exemptions for evading or attempting to evade game bans. Antagonists who impersonate or take over a role which they are banned from to aid in their goals are not considered to be evading their role ban.

  ### Additional Information
  - https://docs.goobstation.com/en/community/admin/goob-station-banning-policy.html

  ### Precedents
  - Incidents of admin abuse or negligence should be reported along with a date and time, along with details to pinpoint the incident in the logs, to any full admin via forum PM or posted on the admin complaints sub-forum located at https://discord.gg/goobstation. Incidents of poorly conducted admin events may also be taken to https://discord.gg/goobstation in their respective feedback threads, for less serious complaints.
  - Lying in adminhelps, misrepresenting facts deliberately, or logging off when an admin has asked a question may result in permabans. Admins will not automatically place bans for players logging off however, and will generally wait a while in case real life situations caused a player to disconnect or go AFK.

 ## Core Rule 7 - Only use English
  Only English is permitted, both in-character and out-of-character. You must be fluent in English enough to be able to not cause game issues, and to be able to communicate with game admins when necessary. If a game admin does not feel that you are fluent enough in English, they may ban you.

  ### Why
  We do not have enough staff fluent in other languages to moderate them. Translation tools can be unreliable and are not integrated well into the game.

  ### Non-English Options
  There are many servers that allow or focus on other languages. You are highly encouraged to play only on servers that allow languages you are fluent in.

  ## Core Rule 8 - Erotic/creepy stuff is not allowed

  No form of erotic roleplay is allowed on the servers, including things that could be construed as sexual by unwilling participants.

## Core Rule 9 - Players need to be the age of 16 or above

  This rule is for the benefit of and is meant to protect people who shouldn't be playing here due to the nature of the SS14 community. Your age won't be hunted down, but if you admit it to us in admin PMs, or other places within our community, you will be removed.
    
    
## Core Rule 10 - Losing is part of the game

  Your character will frequently die, sometimes without even a possibility of avoiding it. Events will often be out of your control. No matter how good or prepared you are, sometimes you just lose.
    
## Core Rule 11 - Bigotry is not allowed.

  Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, disability, orientation or the like is not tolerated.

  ### Precedents
- This rule applies to ALL OOC bigotry, even when expressed in IC. There is no racism in 2565, just species-ism: there is no homophobia, just xenophiliaphobia, etc.
 - Admins are encouraged to use rule 1 to deal with instances where """IC""" bigotry is excessive or designed as a mask for OOC bigotry.
  - Context is important, but somebody being an out and proud bigot, nazi, or white supremacist also counts as context. Somebody who makes it known they are bigoted towards PoCs playing a PoC character that starts checking stereotype boxes isn't going to fool us.
  - Obvious or common real life replacements of offensive words or slurs used in IC are not allowed. For example, you may not insult a lizard by calling them the L- and ending with er as an N-word derivative will result in your permanent removal. Be creative.

    # Core Rule 13 - Use realistic character names, and do not use names of famous people
  - No names of people or characters fictional or real from our world. You are not slick if you switch a few letters around.
  - No titles/honorifics (Exceptions being generational titles like "Jr" or "I", "II", "III", etc), nicknames, or shortenings. Use proper capitalization (e.g. NOT J Hoffman or jaiden mallow).
  - Must follow all other rules (no slurs/sexual names/etc)
  - Usernames, objects, random characters, very "low effort" names, "meta" names, or otherwise implausible names cannot be used as names. See examples below.
  - Admin rulings on IC names are final and disputes should be done through the forums, not by refusing to comply with an admin
  - Species have naming conventions that are part of their in-universe culture. These may be subverted if they have sufficient in-character reasoning and effort to explain their non-standard name. Non-standard names are held to higher scrutiny and you may be questioned on why your name breaks these conventions.

  # Naming Conventions:
  Clowns and mimes are exempt from the prohibition on titles/honorifics and have loosened restrictions on low-effort and implausible names.

  ## Clarification on "Meta" Names
  Meta names attempt to take advantage of some game mechanic or game design choice. "Urist McHands" is a meta name because it is the default name for admin-spawned humans. "Operator Whiskey" is a meta name because it follows the naming pattern of nuclear operatives. This rule is not intended to prevent things like nuclear operatives using a fake ID with names that appear to be nuclear operative names if they decide that they want to do that.

  ## Conventions and Examples

  Any name considered [color=#449944]Good:[/color] can be used for the species it falls under. Any names considered [color=#994444]Bad:[/color] cannot be used for that specie or any other species.

  Tajaran names consist of first name and last name. They're usually difficult to pronounce and are made up of syllabes such as "raj", "tajr", "hrar" or "khaz". Both first and last name follow this convention, but last names "Hadii" "Kaytam" "Zhan-Khazan" "Hharar" "Njarir'Akhan" should generally be preferred.
