    <h1>Main Rules - read these if nothing else</h1>
    <p><h1>0. Enforcement of these rules is at the discretion of admins.</h1>
Roleplay is king, and admins can disregard other rules to this end should it prove beneficial for the experience of the shift. Admins are also allowed to intervene in rounds when it is in the best interest of the playerbase.</p>

<p>Rule 0 Precedents.</p>

  <p><h1>1. Don't be a dick.</h1>
Be excellent to each other. If you enjoy trying to ruin someone else’s good time, you won’t have a place here. Being a jerk in-character is fine to a point, but being a jerk out of character is not welcome.</p>

<p>Rule 1 Precedents.</p>
