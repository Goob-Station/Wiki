</div>
<h1>Animal Harm and Cruelty (A)</h1>
  
  <p>Animal Harm and Animal Cruelty are two different crimes specifying the abuse/harm to station animals and personal pets. </p>
  
  <p>- This does not extend to pests that live on the station, such as mothroaches, mice, rats, lootbugs, and more. </p>
  
  <h2>Animal Harm</h2>
  
  <p>Animal harm is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that does not result in it going into a critical state. </p>
  
  <p>- A minor punch or so isn't worth charging over, an infraction warning being sufficient, but harming more than just a punch is worth investigating. </p>
  
  <h2>Animal Cruelty</h2>
  
  <p>Animal cruelty is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that results in it going into a critical state and/or dying. </p>
  
  <p>- Animal Cruelty is worth investigating for other crimes when the animal and/or pet dies, for potential other grievances between the offender and victim. </p>

  <h1>Assault and Manslaughter (V)</h1>
  
  <p>Assault ranges from a simple Disturbance all the way to Manslaughter, Murder, and Prime/Mass Murder. </p>
  
  <p>The <b> primary difference </b> is to the degree of the assault/murder, and how it happened. </p>
  
  <h2>Disturbance and Assault</h2>
  
  <p> Simple scuffles, causing problems for others, harassing, and the likes can boil down to a <b>Disturbance</b> and should be warned. </p>
  
  <p> If there is a hands-on moment and people get injured or hurt, but only minor wounds that are easily taken care of, this would be <b>Assault</b>. </p>
  
  <p>- The difference between a Disturbance and an Assault charge is whether it was hands-on or not, and whether violence happened. </p>
  
  <p>- Disturbances: The catch-all for obnoxious crewmates. </p>
  
  <p>Covers things such as public nudity, needless insults, obstructing authorities, and inciting crime or violence. </p>
  
  <p>Generally covers things that aren't explicitly illegal. </p>
  
  <h2>Aggravated Assault</h2>
  
  <p>The difference between Assault and Aggravated Assault is the intent to grievously harm to the point nearing (or achieving) a critical state of injury. </p>
  
  <p>- To take physical action against a person with intent to grievously harm, but not to kill. Assaulting someone to the point of them critting or intending to achieve that. </p>
  
  <h2>Manslaughter and Murder</h2>
  
  <p>The difference between Manslaughter and Murder is intent. Did the individual accidentally kill someone (such as crossfire) or did they kill them with the intent to take their life? </p>
  
  <p>- Manslaughter: To unintentionally kill someone through negligent, but not malicious, actions. Murder would be purposefully ending someone's life. </p>
  
  <h2>Prime/Mass Murder</h2>
  
  <p>Prime/Mass Murder is an encompassing charge for two separate cases. If the suspect has killed three (3) or more individuals, then it is considered <b>Mass Murder</b> </p>
  
  <p>However, if the suspect has killed even one person and then gone through lengths of dismembering and/or have gone through steps of preventing their revival, it would be <b>Prime Murder</b> . </p>
  
  <p>- Prime Murder: To commit the act of murder, with clear intent to kill, and clear intent or to have materially take steps to prevent the revival of the victim. </p>
  
  <p>- Mass Murder: To commit multiple murders en masse, targeting three (3) or more people. </p>
  
  <h1>Contraband Possession (C)</h1>
  <p>Contraband Possession comes in a variety of forms and tiers of severity. These are outlined in more detail below. </p>
  
  <p>- Contraband comes in many forms, but is generalized as items, equipment, and/or materials that are not approved for use on NanoTrasen Stations. </p>
  
  <p>These items include, but are not limited to: Items produced by Syndicate, The Wizard, Cultist Nature, Heretics, Changelings, Nuclear Operatives, and more. </p>
  
  <h2>Contraband, Minor</h2>
  <p>Minor Contraband extends to items that do not put much threat to life, such as implanting devices, syndicate drugs, non-lethal magical books, and more. </p>
  
  <p>- This includes equipment that would not normally be accessible by any crew on the station, including equipment that is not normally accessible to crew members that are not in Security/Command (such as having armor and combat globes or jackboots as a non-Security personnel). </p>
  
  <p>- Items classified as minor contraband are not lethal and cannot be used for lethal purposes. </p>
  
  <h2>Contraband, Major</h2>
  <p>Major Contraband extends to items that can put threat to life, cause station damage (en masse), such as weapons, advanced armors/hardsuits, explosions, and more. </p>
  
  <p>- This includes equipment that poses a threat to life on the station and would not normally be accessible to anyone on the station except Security/Command. </p>
  
  <p>Station personnel possessing equipment normally found in the Armory/Vault that has lethal capabilities or powerful technology (such as Lecters and Riot Suits) would be considered Major Contraband as regular Station Personnel do not have access to these. </p>
  <p>- Anything related to Nuclear Operatives would also be considered Major Contraband. </p>
  
  <h2>Contraband, Corporate</h2>
  <p>Corporate Contraband is contraband explicitly relating to corporate secrets, such as blackboxes and the likes. This is contraband that is considered property of NanoTrasen and/or other Corporations that work with NanoTrasen, such as company secrets that can be retrieved from damaged stations or ruins. </p>
  <p>- Corporate Contraband explicitly refers to: To possess secret documentation or high density tamper-resistant data storage devices (Blackboxes) from any organization without authorization by Nanotrasen. </p>
  <p>- Anything else related to this charge is explicitly materials such as <b> Nuclear Fission Devices </b> and <b> Nuclear Authorization Disks </b> for such devices. </p>
  
  <h1>Disruption and Disturbances (X)</h1>
  
  <p>Disruptions and Disturbances of Peace relate to matters concerning blatant misuse of Communications and organization of movements to disrupt normal operations of a department, not related to Rioting. </p>
  
  <p>There are several differences between these two, but they are classified under Disruptions in general for easier convenience of charges and escalation when there are minor changes. Disruptive Communications can easily lead to Distrubances of Peace.</p>
  
  <h2>Disruptive Communications (Disruption)</h2>
  
  <p>Disruptive Communications boils down to simple misuse of Communications Channels in Department or Common. This can be affiliated with spamming unnecessary information or repetitive words into the Communications Channel, to using Communications Channels for unnecessary chatter not necessary for the respective channel. </p>
  
  <p>- Some examples could pertain to spamming the channels. Others would be conversations that could be done so locally or in-private over a communications channel that doesn't pertain to the conversation or scenario. </p>
  
  <p>- This is a liberally taken and decisive charge to apply to someone, so it is classified as an infraction and should be warned before prosecuting such charges.
 </p>
  
  <h2>Disturbance of Peace</h2>
  
  <p>The Disturbance of Peace charge is a minor form of organization that does not become violent like Rioting, hence the Minor Severity of the charge. </p>
  
  <p>- To knowingly organize a movement which disrupts the normal operations of a department, or being a public disturbance. </p>
  
  <h1>Drug Possession and Distribution (D)</h1>
  
  <p>Drug Possession and Drug Distribution are two separate crimes that cannot be stackable. If the offender is distributing drugs, they take the higher severity offense, Drug Distribution. </p>
  
  <h2>Drug Possession</h2>
  
  <p>Drug Possession is specifically the carrying of chemicals, substances, and/or any other drug-like entity in large quantities. </p>
  
  <p>- To make, hold, or abuse restricted drugs or chemicals. </p>
  
  <h2>Illegal Distribution (Drugs)</h2>
  
  <p>Illegal Distribution is the distribution of a large quantity of drugs that are considered narcotics or do not serve a purpose outside of the medical bay or medicinal purposes. These can and should extend to drugs that are considered contrband as well. </p>
  
  <p>For further processing, this extends to willingly giving out drugs or equipment that can produce drugs in large quantities. </p>
  
  <p>- This does not extend to a few pills or the likes that can be used recreationally. The exception being if the "recreational" use is violent in nature or harmful to crewmembers. </p>
  
  <p>- The possession of dangerous or illegal drugs/equipment in a quantity greater than that which is reasonable for personal consumption. </p>
  
  <h1>Hostile Agents (H)</h1>
  
  <p>Hostile Agents extends to any antagonistic individuals or teams of individuals that pose a threat to the station and/or NanoTrasen as a corporation. </p>
  
  <p>These individuals come in a variety of severity as do the charges, so you should follow this section for a more efficient understanding of sentencing. </p>
  
  <h2>Hostile Agent</h2>
  
  <p>Hostile Agents are confirmed individuals with alliances to another organization working against the Station and/or NanoTrasen. </p>
    
  <p>This includes traitors and thieves that are working to undermine the efforts of NanoTrasen and its personnel aboard this station. </p>
  
  <p>These individuals must not have committed egregious crimes, such as murdering or sabotaging en masse to be charged with this. If they have performed such crimes, they should be charged with Hostile Activity instead. </p>
  
  <p>- Syndicate Traitors and Thieves should be charged with this if they have not committed other crimes that have resulted in deaths and/or lack of functionality for certain jobs/departments. </p>
  
  <p>- This also extends to attempting to recruit others, as such: To knowingly act as a recruiter, representative, messenger, ally, benefactor, or other associate of an enemy corporation. </p>
  
  <h2>Hostile Activity</h2>
  
  <p>To be a Hostile Agent (or station personnel, in some cases) that is committing massive dangers to the station; whether it be station sabotage, murders, mass theft, and/or more, this is generally the charge that is associated with such cases. </p>
    
  <p>This can also extend to any personnel that impede Security's intent to apprehend a criminal, walling off a critical area (such as vault, medbay, bridge, et cetera) and more activity that would be a major flaw to the Station. </p>
  
  <p>- Hostile Activity should be charged to enemies of the station that have been confirmed to have committed several crimes against the station, alongside their objectives to do such crimes. </p>
  
  <p>- This is not exclusively limited to Hostile Agents, but should be the next charge for Hostile Agents that fall into this category. </p>
  
  <h2>Enemy of the Station</h2>
  
  <p>Enemy of the Station is a large charge and a very severe one to inflict on someone. You should think about their stance against NanoTrasen and the Station prior to issuing a charge like this on any personnel. </p>
    
  <p>This is effectively listing them as a guaranteed threat that should be eliminated, whether it be by permanent brigging with supervision or execution. </p>
  
  <p>An "Enemy of the Station" must be powerful enough to be a massive threat to the station. While Syndicate Traitors are not classified as such, they are <b> not exempt </b> from this charge if they acquire enough power to be considered a massive station threat (such as an individual with DAGD). </p>
  
  <p>Anyone labeled an "Enemy of the Station" must be tried in court for permanent brigging with the ability to defend themselves, if apprehended without lethal takedown or posing an active threat. </p>
  
  <p>- To be a member of any of the following organizations clearly conspiring for the destruction of station or mass damage to its personnel like Nuclear Operatives, Wizards, Space Pirates, Heretics, Cultists, Changelings, et cetera.
 </p>
  
  <h1>Negligence (N)</h1>
  
  <p>Negligence comes in many levels of severity and can even extend to the death or mass death of the station for how it is classified.  These are explained further below. </p>
  
   <h2>Negligence, Minor and Major</h2>
  
  <p>The difference between Minor Negligence and Major Negligence is the level of threat it has imposed on someone or several people.  This is primarily how affected an individual was by the negligence. </p>
  
  <p>Did it leave someone severely hurt (but not crit)? Then it would be Major Negligence. </p>
  
  <p>If it only harmed and was easily corrected, not leaving someone severely wounded but also potentially having gone that far?  Then it would only be Minor Negligence. </p>
  
  <p>- Major Negligence is classified as: To be negligent in one's duty to an extent that it may cause harm to multiple individuals, a department, or in a manor which directly leads to a serious injury of another person which requires emergency medical treatment. </p>
  
  <p>Some more notes are shown below, for a breakup of how Negligence can, and should, be classified. </p>
  
  <p>- Minor Negligence would be something like: This is the charge for the doctor that accidentally pumps pentetic acid into an oozeling, or a scientist who accidentally floods toxins with room temperature CO2 or N2O. </p>
  
  <p>- An Atmospheric Technician messing up the airlock and releasing a burn chamber into the TEG wouldn't be Major until it killed and harmed others before being corrected. </p>
  
   <h2>Dereliction</h2>
  
  <p>Dereliction is the willfull abandonment of a position or job that causes a danger to be present, such as an Atmospheric Technician leaving ignoring the use of a holofan and letting a plasma flood spread into a hallway and refusing to fix the issue. </p>
  
  <p>- Dereliction is specifically classified as: To willfully abandon an obligation that is critical to the station's continued operation. </p>
  
   <h2>Manslaughter and Biological Terror</h2>
  
  <p>Manslaughter and Biological Terror are linked to negligence causing full death or mass death to a station. Biological Terror primarily focuses on the releasing of a reagent that causes a virus to spread that's harmful to the station. </p>
  
  <p>- Manslaughter is the same as listed in Assault: To unintentionally kill someone through negligent, but not malicious, actions. </p>
  
  <p>- Biological Terror is: To knowingly release, cause, or otherwise cause the station to become affected by a disease, plant, or other biological form which may spread unconstrained and or cause serious physical harm. </p>
  
  <h1>Psionics (E)</h1>
  
  <p>There are several regulations around Psionics, with varying degrees of severity and different effects within the severities. </p>
    
  <p>This will group them up into a better-to-understand category for each section of this grouping to consolidate the size of this entry. </p>
  
  <h2>Unreported Psionics and Lying</h2>
  
  <p>Unreported Psionics extends to the deliberate intention to not report your Psionics and being caught with psionic abilities, while Lying About Psionics extends to intentionally Lying to a Psionic Authority (such as Mystagogue, Mantis, and Cataloguer), Security Official, and/or a Command Member about your Psionic Abilities. </p>
  
  <p>- Unreported Psionics and Lying About Psionics related to deliberately hiding your Psionic Abilities. Lying is intentionally doing so
  while not reporting is not necessarily lying unless there is an attempt to deceive an individual about psionic capabilities. </p>
  
  <h2>Mindbreaking</h2>
  
  <p>Mindbreaking is addressed before Psionics Misuse due to the severity of its charge and how important it is to acknowledge it as a crime. </p>
    
    
  <p>Mindbreaking an individual without consent and without due justice for it (such as high levels of glimmer and the individual is misuing their
  powers to raise the glimmer or harm others). </p>
  
  <p>- To unlawfully and maliciously rid a psionic sophont of their powers. </p>
  
  <h2>Misuse of Psionics</h2>
  
  <p>Maliciously/Unintentionally Misusing Psionics comes in many forms of severity, and mostly extends to <i> how severe </i> the misuse is. </p>
    
  <p> This is split into three severity levels ranging from minor misuse to dangerous (station endangering) use of psionics. </p>
  
  <p>- Familiars and any other outcomes of Psionics Abilities are the responsibility of the Psionic User that summoned/created them, and should be attributed to the Psionic User if/when they cause issues for others. It is the Psionic User's fault, and they should pay the price. </p>
  
  <h2>Psionics Misuse</h2>
  
  <p>The Psionics Misuse is attributed to intentionally (or unintentionally) misuse psionics in a non-lethal or non-endangering way. Some examples are shown below. </p>
  
  <p>- Examples include spamming telepathy, mindswapping with non-sophont lifeforms many times, and using psionics in a way that generates glimmer excessively. </p>
  
  <h2>Malicious Psionics Use</h2>
  
  <p>Malicious Psionics Use is the use of Psionics in such a way that they endanger others, primarily following the thought process of: </p>
  
  <p>Prohibits harmful misuse of psionics, causing danger, trauma, or detrimental alterations to others or the station. Some more notes are shown below: </p>
  
  <p>- Individuals convicted under this act must wear anti-psionic helmet for the full duration of their sentence, removing it is akin to breaking out of prison. </p>
  <p>- Sophonts charged under this sentence are to be evaluated as potential candidates for mindbreaking or sacrifical use in the events of code white emergency. </p>
  <p>- Cases involving the misuse of lethal psionic powers or familiars fall under Code 4XX and should be treated as a Major Offense. </p>
  
  <p>Examples include mindswapping with sophont lifeforms (sapient/sentient creatures on the station) and putting them in danger, deliberately summoning familiars and unsummoning them to raise glimmer, causing hazards with abilities that could lead to endangerment of crew, and more. </p>
  
  <h2>Dangerous Psionics Use</h2>
  
  <p>Dangerous Psionics Use falls under the same pretense as Malicious Psionics Use, but with more danger on the lives of crewmates and other sophont lifeforms, as well as endangering the station, much like Sabotage levels. </p> 
  
  <p> This form of severity extends to accidentally/intentionally killing someone with psionic abilities and/or destroying the station with psionic abilities that endangers crew to such cases. </p>
  
  <p>- Individuals convicted under this act must wear anti-psionic helmet for the full duration of their sentence, removing it is akin to breaking out of prison. </p>
  
  <p>- Sophonts charged under this sentence are to be selected first as candidates for sacrifical use in the events of code white emergency. </p>
  
  <p>- Cases involving lethal use of psionic powers in such a way that they caused several murders and/or mass station sabotage are to be sacrificed regardless of the station alert level. </p>
  
  <p>This primarily covers use cases where the psionic misuse was used as a weapon against the crew or station and has caused massive damage with the use of the psionic abilities. This also, as stated above, extends to uncontrolled familiars that cause such damages, but this can be defended and is up to sentencing officers on how it is treated (as not all cases are able to be stopped, i.e. raiders). </p>
  
  <h1>Rioting (R)</h1>
  
  <p>Rioting comes in many forms, but primarily is associated with the violent nature of an organized group of individuals that cause damages and/or harm other members of the station. </p>
  
  <h2>Rioting</h2>
  
  <p>Rioting refers to the act of associating oneself as a member in a group which collectively commits acts of vandalism, or other felony crimes. </p>
  
  <p>- A riot typically constitutes five or more people acting in a coordinated effort. This can however vary on the size and circumstances of the station. </p>
  
  <h2>Inciting a Riot</h2>
  
  <p>Inciting a Riot refers to performing actions in the interest of causing large amounts of unrest up to and including rioting. </p>
  
  <p>- This is for the ring leader in any insurrection or riot. </p>
  
  <p>- Prisoners may have their radios removed and be contained in areas which are not visible to the general populace.</p>
  
  <h2>Subversion of Command</h2>
  
  <p>Subversion of Command refers to intentionally attempting to overthrow the Chain of Command on the station, including Dignitaries in this as well.
 </p>
  
  <p>Another description would be: Disrupting the chain of command via either murder of a commanding officer or illegally declaring oneself to be a commanding officer. </p>
  
  <p>- Security officers are not considered to be commanding officers. Heads of Staff, Captains, Central Command Officials, and Dignitaries are. </p>
  
  <p>- This does not include replacement of heads of staff with solid reasoning backing it. (Derelection, Negligence, Unfit for Job, et cetera.) </p>
  
  <h1>Vandalism and Sabotage (S)</h1>
  
  <p>Vandalism eventually leads to a severity of Sabotage and Massive Station Sabotage. This shows the escalation of the levels and how they should, ideally, be treated when sentencing someone with this grouping charge.
 </p>
  
  <h2>Subversion of Command</h2>
  
  <p>Vandalism comes in three categories before it is subjected to the categorization of Sabotage and Grand Sabotage. These are described in more detail below with notes. </p>
  
  <h2>Subversion of Command</h2>
  
  <p>To intentionally deface or superficially damage public or private property. </p>
  
  <p>- Minor damage that can be repaired with space cleaner or other cosmetic only damage. </p>
  
  <h2>Vandalism Minor</h2>
  
  <p>To damage, destroy, or permanently deface non-critical furniture, vendors, or personal property. </p>
  
  <p>- Large amounts of irreparable damage should be charged with Major Vandalism, Damage to critical infrastructure may be a form of Sabotage. </p>
  
  <h2>Vandalism Major</h2>
  
  <p> To destroy or damage non-critical furniture, vendors, or personal property in a manor that can not be repaired.</p>
  
  <p>- Spray painting all the lights red and wrecking tables in the bar is fun and all, but it makes it hard to figure out where the fire is, or to have a polite sip of tea. </p>
  
  <h2>Sabotage</h2>
  
  <p>Sabotage has two categorizations, Sabotage and Grand Sabotage. The difference between these is how dangerous it has made the environment, how much of the station is damaged, and how many people are affected by the sabotaging acts. </p>
  
  <p>- Sabotage is classified as: To destroy station assets or resources critical to normal or emergency station procedures, or cause sections of the station to become uninhabitable. </p>
  
  <p>Sabotaging primarily covers: spacing areas, tampering with fire alarms; pipes; wiring, disabling the emitters on the Supermatter, and other general station assets. This also includes unauthorized construction. </p>
  
  <p>- While Grand Sabotage is classified as: To destroy or modify station assets or equipment without which the station may collapse or otherwise become uninhabitable. </p>
  
  <p>Grand Sabotage primarily covers: tampering with station records, purposefully delaminating the SM, destroying the SMES power storage equipment, plasma flooding, or super-heating the air distribution system (distro).
 </p>
  
  <h1>Thievery and Fraud (F)</h1>
  
  <p>Thievery and Fraud are both coinciding in the general crime of stealing something that isn't yours. These are categorized in four categories of severity ranging from simple pick-pocketing to thievery and fraud from the station at large. </p>
  
  <h2>Pick-Pocketing</h2>
  
  <p>Pick-Pocketing is a simple crime that involves stripping items from individuals that don't carry much value or interest, but is still an asset that isn't supposed to be in the offenders' inventory. </p>
  
  <p>- Small or easily replaceable items should be charged with this, otherwise consider a higher class of theft. </p>
  
  <h2>Thievery/Fraud Minor and Major</h2>
  
  <p>Thievery/Fraud covers stealing items and/or impersonating people to commit fraud and obtain items that are not yours by default. </p>
  
  <p>- Minor is classified with: This includes things like insulated gloves, crew pinpointers, normal ID cards, or personal items; while </p>
  
  <p> - Major is classified with: To steal rare, extraordinarily expensive (Items of greater than 1000 credit value), or restricted equipment from secure areas or people. </p>
  
  <p>The items stolen must also be checked for contraband. Items stolen like armory equipment would be Major Thievery, not Grand Theft. </p>
  
  <h2>Grand Theft/Fraud</h2>
  
  <p>Grand Theft/Fraud is extraordinary thievery or fraud that has resulted in significant value loss from the station or peoples of the station. </p>
  
  <p>- To steal inherently dangerous items from their storage, one's person, or other such methods acquire through illicit means. This includes items that are considered major/corporate contraband, such as nuclear disks and Command-specific equipment en masse. </p>
  
  <p>- There must be multiple items stolen or the items must be considered extremely severe (such as nuclear authorization disk). </p>
  
  <h1>Trespassing (T)</h1>
  
  <p>Trespassing, also referring to Breaking and Entering (which is inherently trespassing), is a crime with several tiers depending on where the individual trespassed and how secure the location is. </p>
  
  <h2>Trespassing (Non-Secure)</h2>
  
  <p>Trespassing in non-secure locations, such as departments that you do not have access/permission to enter, is a minor crime that can usually be let off with no charge depending on the severity of any tangent crimes committed. </p>
  
  <p>This is something issued with discretion and can be pressed by Department members or members of authority that wish to press the charge due to the effect it had on them. </p>
  
  <p>- To be in an area which a person has either not purposefully been admitted to, does not have access, or has been asked to leave by someone who has access to that area. </p>
  
  <h2>Trespassing Secure</h2>
  
  <p>Trespassing in Secure Areas (primarily areas where Security has access to and others do not, but is not explicitly this definition) is a crime that should be punished but may be lessened to a minor crime if deemed as such with discretion. </p>
  
  <p> Areas that this includes tend to be Chemistry, Atmopsherics, Security (not including Armory, which is next severity level), and Anomaly Generation. </p>
  
  <p>- Trespassing in an area which may lead to the injury of self, or others. This also includes areas like security or general command areas which do not contain any sensitive items or consoles. </p>
  
  <h2>Trespassing High Secure</h2>
  
  <p>Trespassing High Secure is trespassing in areas that are limited only to Security and Command personnel with higher levels of access.  This is a definite punishment that cannot be lowered by normal circumstances. </p>
  
  <p>This includes areas like the Vault, Bridge, any Command Personnel's room, Armory, Warden, Permanent Bridge, and any area specifically locked to Command Personnel. </p>
  
  <p>- Trespassing in any of the following without appropriate permission or access: Command areas, Personal offices, Weapons storage, weapon production, explosive storage, explosive production, or other high security areas. </p>
  
  <h1>Ungrouped Crime Charges</h1>
  
  <p>The following crimes are not grouped and can be stacked with others without worrying about conflicts of severity. </p>
    
  <p>These crimes are split into multiple categories of severity and do not increase or decrease in severity, without special circumstances and discretion. </p>
  
  <h2>Vigilantism</h2>
  
  <p>An individual participating in hunting a known antagonist without permission from Security/Command is considered to be a vigilante and should be charged as such. </p>
  
  <p>- "<i>Validhunting is not okay.</i>" </p>
  
  <h2>Failure to Comply</h2>
  
  <p>Failure to Comply is a broadened term mostly referring to intentionally refusing to listen to orders from Security (when appropriate for them to give such orders) and listening from legal orders from Head of Staff of their respective department. </p>
  
  <p>- To knowingly disobey a lawful order from a superior, or obstructing security from doing it's job.
 </p>
  
  <h2>Kidnapping/Identity Theft</h2>
  
  <p>This is a broadedened term to encapsulate multiple crimes, and is <b> the only crime that can stack with itself</b> when performing both of the acts it defines (i.e. kidnapping someone and then pursuing their identity). </p>
  
  <p>- Kidnapping falls under: To cause a intellectual being's unlawful confinement or restriction of free movement against their will. This act can involve the use of force, threats, or deception. </p>
  
  <p>- Identity Theft falls under: To pursue someone else's identity as if it were your own, and falsely claim their identity for yourself. This includes stealing a PDA/ID with the intent to masquerade oneself as the individual. This does not count towards that crime if the PDA/ID is not used to deceive others of the identity. </p>
  
  <h2>Refusal of Mental Shielding</h2>
  
  <p>To refuse mental shielding when it is deemed necessary by Command/Security personnel (this does not include promotion procedures. The individual should not be promoted if they refuse to be mindshielded). </p>
  
  <p>- The individual charged with this may request a trial if they wish to do so, but should remained Permanently Brigged if they refuse to be mentally shielded when it is required to (i.e. a Revolution is confirmed). </p>
  
  <h2>Espionage</h2>
  
  <p>Espionage is charged against individuals that deliberately assist Coupes or other forms of betrayal against NanoTrasen and/or the Station as a whole. </p>
  
  <p>- To knowingly betray critical information to enemies of the station. </p>
  
  <p>- Telling nukies where the disk or a pinpointer is would wind up here. Please note, knowingly assisting antagonists as a non-antag may violate server rules. </p>
