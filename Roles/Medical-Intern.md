# Medical Intern![medical_intern.png](/lrp/roles/medical/medical_intern.png)
###### Welcome to hell, kid. 
Medical intern is meant to be the players first entry into medbay. Here you will learn some of the essentials, such as using topicals, chems, and getting your first tastes of the more juicy systems like chems and surgery. The addition of woundmed has added a lot of complexity to the department, so good on you for taking initiative and looking into the basics. Speaking of the basics...

## The Basics
First and foremost, you need to know when someone is hurt. To this end, you will need to medically scan your patients, which you can do with either your PDA or a medical scanner. Your PDA if you started as any medical job is a medical scanner, and you can use it by holding it in your hand and clicking on any player. Otherwise, you can get a scanner from the Nanomed machine in medical, or the CMO can upgrade your PDA with the scanner app. Once you have a medical scan of your patient, you can see their total damage, and click on parts of the body onscreen to the amount of damage on specific parts. 

## Healing the Wounds 
Now that you have a scan of the Patients data, it's time to treat! Firstly, you need to use the targeter in the bottom right of the screen to select the injured body part, and then apply the correct medicine. Note that you only have to select a specific body part for topical medicines (see below). 

- Bruise packs Treat Brute damages (Blunt, Slash, and Pierce.)
- Ointments heal Burns (Burn, Cold, Shock)
- Gauze treats slash and most importantly stops bleeding. 
- Blood packs refill blood level, and do not need to be aimed at specific body parts. 

Also note that some injuries, like broken bones, and more exotic damage types, require either chemical or surgeries. See below for the basics of chemistry, and see the doctors page for some insights into surgerey.

## Chemistry and You
Wether it comes to dealing with full body injury in a flash, or simply needing to treat poison, ratiation, or caustic damages, you will need to learn to work with what chemistry has made for you. Luckily for you, a good chemist will already have labeled each chemical with the damage it heals, and the safe dose you can use. Chems are usually stored in the main room in a locker, but always ask a chemist if you are having trouble finding it! For using chems:

- Find where the chems are stored, and the chem you want to use. 
- Use a syringe to extract the amount of the chemical you need. 
- Ensure your syringe is set to inject, and click on your patient. 
- Monitor the patient and watch the medicine work!

## More than Just Healing
As an intern, remember that you will learn the most by working under others, and will see the most by asking others how you can help. Chemistry and the CMO will always have a useful fetch quest for you if you need something to do, and the kitchen can always spare a monkey or two for you to teach yourself surgery or experement with chems. 

## Your Gear and You
In medical, you have access to some critical tools, that you should remember the locations of or keep on you:

#### For items you should carry around. 
- A medical HUD or eyepatch, which you can find in lockers or the Nanomed, which shows the health bar of everyone nearby
- A belt filled with basic medical gear, which you spawn with

#### For items you should know the location of
- The defibrillator can be used to revive a dead person, assuming their damage is below 200 and they are not rotted. 
- Bodybags, which will store a corpes indefinitely and pause all rotting.
