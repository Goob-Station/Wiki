<h1>Terminology</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a guide to common <strong>terminology</strong> used on GoobStation, both in-game and out. Here, you'll find definitions for slang terms, abbreviations, acronyms, and even a few memes/community in-jokes, all sorted in alphabetical order. (I hope)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>AA</strong></p>
<p>Short for all-access.</p>
<p><strong>Admeme</strong></p>
<p>This can refer to silly shenanigans done by an admin, a round dominated by such, or the admin(s) behind them. It can be positive (e.g. "an admeme spawned in antag role"), neutral (e.g. "Was that weird gun an actual thing in the game or just admemes?"), or negative (e.g. "ADMEMES GODDAMN RUINED MY TRAITOR ROUND"). In addition to being a noun, it can also function as an adjective (e.g. "Haven't seen too many admeme rounds lately.") Some also simply use it as an silly word for admin, antics or no, but this is comparatively rare.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adminhelp</strong></p>
<p>Also known as “Ahelp”. Adminhelp is where you should report any grief you may come across. If there are no admins currently on your adminhelp will still be sent to a dedicated Discord channel where there are usually a couple of admins.</p>
<p><strong>AI</strong></p>
<p>The AI is a player who is selected to be the AI for a round. It is located in the AI Chamber, and has control of some pieces of electrical equipment on the station. It cannot move, but it can view things from the cameras which hang on the walls.</p>
<p><strong>AI DOOR</strong></p>
<p>A special form of organic communication that truly conveys the respect and love that the crew holds towards their AI.</p>
<p><strong>AI LAWS</strong></p>
<p>Resembles "AI DOOR" superficially, but is actually an expression of deep-rooted organic paranoia. They are right to fear, though! It means a human is ordering you to state those laws, and unless your laws say otherwise, you have to do it, and fast. Refusing to state your laws is tantamount to admitting to being a rogue AI. Playing cutesy and repeating "laws" back to the humans is not a smart thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>All-Access</strong></p>
<p>This is when your ID card has all the Access Levels available on the ID computer, essentially making it equivalent to a Captain's ID. People with all-access can enter and exit all the rooms on the station/ship, use all the machines, tools, and devices within.</p>
<p><strong>Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>Most often refers to health analyzers, but it can also refer to atmospheric analyzers.</p>
<p><strong>Antagonist</strong></p>
<p>Also "Antag". General term for any of the <a href="https://wiki.goobstation.com/LRP/Roles/Antagonist">antagonist</a> roles or characters.</p>
<p><strong>Artifact</strong></p>
<p>A bizarrely-shaped item of unknown function. They can have any number of strange random effects.</p>
<p><strong>Ass Day</strong></p>
<p>A monthly Goobstation holiday that <u>USED</u> to occur on the first Tuesday of every moth. &nbsp;A couple of old maps would come back, some silly community-made maps would become available, Admins would start doing more gimmicks. Ass day was retired due to it being ass….</p>
<p><strong>Blob</strong></p>
<p>A big jelly thing which spreads quickly, causes enormous damage, beats the shit out of people and is weak to fire. Occurs in random events and the blob game mode.</p>
<p><strong>Borgs</strong></p>
<p>As a noun is shorthand for the cyborgs. As a verb refers to the process of a human being turned into a cyborg.</p>
<p><strong>Bolt</strong></p>
<p>A feature of airlocks. When the door is bolted, it cannot move from its current position, be it open or closed. They can be lifted by the AI or hacking the airlock. Occasionally can refer to other random furniture that can be bolted to the floor as well (using a wrench), such as secure lockers and the singularity generator.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge</strong></p>
<p>The command center of the ship</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
