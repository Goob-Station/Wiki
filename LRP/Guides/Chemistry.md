Guide to Chemistry

# Chemist

Now you've done it. You picked the one job where -math- is mandatory. Grab your beaker, pull up a chair, and get cracking, it's time to cook up some chems.

With the advent of woundmed, chemistry has become an essential part of keeping the crew alive.

This role is also very self centered, so if you like long periods of time to yourself while you make cool things, its a good job for you!

While chemists primarily make medications, there's a very wide variety of chemicals that can be made, all of which are showcased in the Chemicals entry of the Guidebook.

## Equipment

Chemists use the following equipment:

-   Chem Dispenser
-   ChemMaster
-   Reagent Grinder
-   Chem Bags
-   Beakers, large and small
-   Bottles
-   Hand Labeler
-   Syringes
-   Pill Canisters
-   And never forget, the humble locker and dufflebag.

## The Basics

Chemistry is fairly straightforward once you know what to expect. Starting out, you'll be expected to make medicinal chems - the easiest is probably Bicaridine, a medicine that treats brute damage, so let's teach you how to make it!
You're going to need:

- a jug
- a beaker
- the Chem Dispenser
- a hand labeler

This is your bare minimum shiftstart kit for making a chemical of any kind!

1. Go to your ChemDispenser and insert your beaker by clicking the dispenser while holding the beaker in your active hand.
2. Click on the dispenser to open its menu. On the amount selection, choose 30.
3. Click the carbon option. You should see the carbon button go from 200 units to 170 units, and your beaker fill up with 30 units of carbon.
4. Do this two more times, and you should have 90 units of carbon in your beaker.
5. Take the beaker out by ejecting it, then emptying it into the jug by placing the beaker on the floor with the Drop button (by default, Q) then clicking and dragging the beaker onto the jug.
6. You should now have a jug with 90 units of carbon and an empty beaker.
7. Put the beaker back into the dispenser, and click the following buttons once: carbon, oxygen, sugar.
8. Your beaker should now be filled with a chemical called inaprovaline. That's good - that's what we want!
9. Take the beaker out and empty it into the jug again. It should become a near full jug with an orange liquid - that's bicaridine!

You can also mix chemicals inside the ChemMaster the same way you do with the dispenser, but you'll need to add chemicals to the buffer to do so. Many chemists prefer to add all their reagents to the ChemMaster to mix chemicals in there instead - give it a go yourself if you want to experiment.

## What about Solid Medicines?

Chemistry is fairly straightforward once you know what to expect. SO what about preparing chemicals for other kinds of situations, or for general use? Well, pills can typically work that angle well.
 <ul>
   <li>Grab a beaker, Pill Canister, and if desired, some Bottles.</li>  
 <li>Place the beaker in the Chemical Dispenser, and Pill Canister (or bottle) in the Chem Master.</li>
 <li>Open the Chemical Dispenser UI, and make your mix. Recipes are in other sections of the guidebook.</li>
 <li>Alt-click the dispenser to remove your beaker, and place it in the Chem Master.</li>
 <li>Open the Chem Master UI. On the Input tab, move your mix into the buffer.</li>
 <li>Move to the Output tab, customise your pill, and press the Create button.</li>
 <li>Alt-click the Chem Master to get the pill bottle out. You may have to remove the beaker first.</li>
 <li>Click on a table, crate, or another surface to empty the pill bottle if desired. Alternatively, store or empty it into another storage container.</li>
   </ul>
 
That's it, you've made your first set of pills! Consider checking with Medical Doctors and other crew to see what else may be requested, refilling the medical kits in medbay storage, or just experimenting! ~~Or you can just give the Clown potassium pills.~~

## Applied Goobmistry

So you have gotten comfortable with the controls, now what is a good approach to this mess?

The best thing to do in chemistry is to have a plan. Know a couple of basic medicines that you can quickly and easily provide to your team. Try to learn a spread of chemicals you are comfortable making quickly to cover most damage types, and writing down steps to make them quickly if you feel so inclined. 

The SECOND best thing to do in chemistry is to lock up your chems. goob has a culture of using duffels and medical lockers as a method to keep chems safe, and that method is easy, cheap, and reliable. 

So what is an example of this? well, here is a pretty typical chemist round start:

- Spawn in, grab a beaker, a duffel, a labeler, and some jugs.
- Make a spread of basic chems, load them into jugs, and label them.
- A good labeling habit is the following: Name - Damage type - Dosage. (Ex: Bicardine - Brute - 15u)
- Load your chems into that dufflebag. 
- Steal a medical locker and a wrench from somewhere, and put the locker in the main treatment area of med.
- Anchor the locker because people will steal it if you dont. 
- Put your duffle of chems in the locker, and a box of syringes.
- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LOCK IT BEHIND YOU WHEN YOU GO!
- Go make more fun chemicals, and put them in the chemlocker when you are done. 

## Baby's First Duffle
So you understand that; Great! here is a basic example duffle of chems with labels for a budding chemist. Note these are Basic chems, and that as you get better, you should ABSOLUTELY learn more fun and powerful chems. Note some of these labels are a little different, and include details, or dont list an overdose if there is none. 
- 1.) Bicardine - Brute - 15uOD
- 2.) Dylovene - Toxin - 20uOD
- 3.) Dermaline - Burn - 10uOD
- 4.) Arithrazine - Rads - use 1/6 of the DMG
- 5.) Tranexamic Acid - Stops Bleeding
- 6.) Saline - Refills Blood - Safe
- 7.) Dexalin+ - Airloss - 25uOD
- 8.) Phalanximine - Converts Cellular to Rad

For steps on how to make these chems, there is a helpful button on the top right of the chemical dispenser that contains all the recipes in the game!
