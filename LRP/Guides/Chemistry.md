Guide to Chemistry

# Chemist

Now you've done it. You picked the one job where -math- is mandatory. Grab your beaker, pull up a chair, and get cracking, it's time to cook up some chems.

With the advent of woundmed, chemistry has become an essential part of keeping the crew alive.

This role is also very self centered, so if you like long periods of time to yourself while you make cool things, its a good job for you!

While chemists primarily make medications, there's a very wide variety of chemicals that can be made, all of which are showcased in the Chemicals entry of the Guidebook.

## Equipment

Chemists use the following equipment:

-   Chem Dispenser
-   ChemMaster
-   Reagent Grinder
-   Chem Bags
-   Beakers, large and small
-   Bottles
-   Hand Labeler
-   Syringes
-   Pill Canisters
-   And never forget, the humble locker and dufflebag.

## The Basics

Chemistry is fairly straightforward once you know what to expect. Here's a simple, step-by-step process on how to begin.

-   Grab a beaker, Pill Canister, and if desired, some Bottles.
-   Place the beaker in the Chemical Dispenser, and Pill Canister (or bottle) in the Chem Master.
-   Open the Chemical Dispenser UI, and make your mix. Recipes are in other sections of the guidebook.
-   Alt-click the dispenser to remove your beaker, and place it in the Chem Master.
-   Open the Chem Master UI. On the Input tab, move your mix into the buffer.
-   Move to the Output tab, customise your pill, and press the Create button.
-   Alt-click the Chem Master to get the pill bottle out. You may have to remove the beaker first.
-   Click on a table, crate, or another surface to empty the pill bottle if desired. Alternatively, store or empty it into another storage container.

That's it, you've made your first set of pills! Consider checking with Medical Doctors and other crew to see what else may be requested, refilling the medical kits in medbay storage, or just experimenting!

You can also use the hand labeler to organize individual bottles or bags without using the Chem Master labeling system.

## Applied Goobmistry

So you have gotten comfortable with the controls, now what is a good approach to this mess?

The best thing to do in chemistry is to have a plan. Know a couple of basic medicines that you can quickly and easily provide to your team. Try to learn a spread of chemicals you are comfortable making quickly to cover most damage types, and writing down steps to make them quickly if you feel so inclined. 

The SECOND best thing to do in chemistry is to lock up your chems. goob has a culture of using duffels and medical lockers as a method to keep chems safe, and that method is easy, cheap, and reliable. 

So what is an example of this? well, here is a pretty typical chemist round start:

- Spawn in, grab a beaker, a duffel, a labeler, and some jugs.
- Make a spread of basic chems, load them into jugs, and label them.
- A good labeling habit is the following: Name - Damage type - Dosage. (Ex: Bicardine - Brute - 15u)
- Load your chems into that dufflebag. 
- Steal a medical locker and a wrench from somewhere, and put the locker in the main treatment area of med.
- Anchor the locker because people will steal it if you dont. 
- Put your duffle of chems in the locker, and a box of syringes.
- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LOCK IT BEHIND YOU WHEN YOU GO!
- Go make more fun chemicals, and put them in the chemlocker when you are done.
