<p>Deep in the annals of the shitcode Goob maintains, lies a forgotten mechanic. In the past, you could have 10,000 effective HP or kill a man by tanking a punch from them while being immune to shocks and burns without wearing a firesuit or insuls in both cases. Then <b>someone<b> made a video using these mechanics to show off the broken effects and someone mald a PR to fix it. And now, the effects lay forgotten and buried beneath the stacks of science... until now.</p>
