<h1>What the fuck is an enchantment?</h1>
<body>
<p>Deep in the annals of the shitcode Goob maintains, lies a forgotten mechanic. In the past, you could have 10,000 effective HP or kill a man by tanking a punch from them while being immune to shocks and burns without wearing a firesuit or insuls in both cases. Then <b>someone</b> made a video using these mechanics to show off the broken effects and someone mald a PR to fix it. And now, the effects lay forgotten and buried beneath the stacks of science... until now. Have fun stealing the cores from Science!</p>
</body>
<h2>So how do?</h2>
<body>
  <p>Well, first you're gonna need a few things:</p>
  <ul>Anomaly cores</ul>
  <ul>The Bible</ul>
  <ul>Some altar of some kind</ul>
  <ul>Any kind of equipment with armour values attached</ul>
<p>Then, you're gonna want to slap all the items save the book onto the altar, right click on the altar and Enchant Dat Shit. Very simple.</p>
