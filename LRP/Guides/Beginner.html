<h1>Goobstation: The Definitive Beginner’s Guide</h1>
<h2>Welcome to the Station</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve just set foot (or claw, tentacle, or oozing pseudopod) on a Goobstation space station — a place where science, questionable engineering, chaos, and minimum-wage labor collide in low orbit. Whether you’re here to roleplay, unravel mysteries, experiment with the law of unintended consequences, or simply see how long you last before being spaced, there’s a spot for you among the crew.</p>
<h2>What is Goobstation?</h2>
<p>Goobstation is a fork of <a href="https://spacestation14.com/">Space Station 14</a>, itself descended from the legendary chaos of <a href="https://spacestation13.com/">Space Station 13</a>. If you’re new to the genre: you and a bunch of other “lucky” employees have been hired by <a href="https://wiki.goobstation.com/LRP/Lore/Nanotrasen">Nanotrasen</a> (the most morally flexible megacorp in the sector) to keep a space station sort-of functional. Everything else — from accidental heroics to system-wide disasters — is up to you. Think of it as a cross between a workplace simulator, a sandbox RPG, and a running joke.</p>
<p>Your station is filled with dozens of different jobs, endless opportunities for shenanigans, and a guarantee that, sooner or later, something will catch fire. Sometimes intentionally. Sometimes not. Each round is a new shift, and no two shifts are ever quite the same.</p>
<h2>Before You Begin: Rules &amp; Survival</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Read the </strong><a href="https://wiki.goobstation.com/Rules/Rules"><strong>Server Rules</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Seriously. These are not suggestions. Press F1 in-game at any time to see them. "But I didn’t know!" is not a defense.</li>
  <li>Don’t murder your coworkers out of boredom or spite. This is not a free-for-all; you’re supposed to pretend to be professionals — or at least not felons.</li>
  <li>"Self-antagging" (creating chaos, sabotaging, attacking, or disrupting things without being assigned as an antagonist) is a quick way to get booted. If you want to be the villain, sign up as one and hope you get picked. Otherwise, your job is to keep the station running—however loosely you define "running."</li>
  <li>Lost? Confused? Welcome to the club. You’re not expected to know everything. Ask for help: in-game (via radio or to nearby players), in the <a href="https://discord.gg/bpHJneTjUb">Discord help channel</a>, or by using the admin help tool ("ahelp"). Don’t spoil active rounds in public channels.</li>
  <li>If you’re new, don’t be afraid to admit it. Most players are happy to explain things—or at least laugh with you rather than at you.</li>
  <li>Don’t share spoilers or details about the current round outside the game (Discord, OOC chat, etc.). Metagaming is not allowed and ruins the fun for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Gets You Banned Instantly</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Random violence (RDM):</strong> Killing, maiming, or sabotaging without good reason.</li>
  <li><strong>Griefing:</strong> Deliberately ruining the round for others (e.g. spamming, destroying critical systems, harassment).</li>
  <li><strong>Metagaming:</strong> Using outside information or knowledge from previous rounds to gain an unfair advantage.</li>
  <li><strong>Ignoring admins, lying during investigations,</strong> or otherwise testing the patience of those who keep the server running.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your First Shift: What Should I Actually Do?</h2>
<h3>1. Character Setup</h3>
<p>Before the round, you’ll customize your character: name, appearance, pronouns, preferred jobs. Set your job preferences — be realistic, you won’t always get your dream job.</p>
<p>For absolute beginners: Set "Assistant" to High, all other jobs to Never. Assistants have no real responsibilities. This gives you space to learn the controls, explore the station, and get lost (possibly in the vents, by accident).</p>
<h3>2. Starting Out</h3>
<p>When you spawn, take a breath. Find your backpack, check what’s inside, and look for any useful survival gear. Open the in-game guide and actually read the controls section! Movement and interaction are a bit different from other games. Learning how to pick things up, push buttons, and scream is essential. If you joined late, you’ll start on a shuttle. Wait for it to dock, then exit to the Arrivals area. The locals may or may not be friendly, but usually they’re just confused.</p>
<h3>3. First Steps on the Station</h3>
<p>Explore! Walk the corridors, meet other crew members, and try to avoid areas labeled with warning signs or blood stains (unless you’re into that). Don’t eat unidentified food or glowing substances—unless you want to roll the dice. If you’re lost, ask for directions or look for a wall map. Most stations have signs, maps, or at least other lost people to join forces with. Don’t be afraid to talk in character (IC). Simple roleplay goes a long way and helps break the ice.</p>
<h3>4. If You Die</h3>
<p>Don’t panic. Everyone dies, especially in their first round. Watch and learn as a ghost, or wait for medbay to (possibly) revive you. There’s no permanent loss, just another story to tell.</p>
<h2>Jobs: So Many Ways to Goof Off, Fail Upwards, or Shine</h2>
<p>The station runs (barely) because people pick up jobs. Service jobs—Chef, Bartender, Botanist, Janitor, Cargo Technician—are great for beginners. They let you interact, help out, and rarely put you in situations where a wrong button explodes the engine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want a challenge, try Medical Intern, Research Assistant, or Technical Assistant. You’ll learn core game systems (and maybe anatomy, chemistry, or the laws of thermodynamics the hard way).</p>
<p>Prefer chaos? Some jobs put you near the action: Security (police), Engineering (keep the power on), or Science (who knows what happens in there). But be warned: these have steep learning curves and high expectations.</p>
<p>You can always change job preferences between rounds as you figure out what you enjoy.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to ask your coworkers for help. Teamwork is actually encouraged.</p>
<h4>Late Joining &amp; Job Switching</h4>
<p>Late joiners start on a shuttle and must wait to dock. If you want to try new roles mid-round, ask the Head of Personnel (HoP) — assuming they haven’t gone missing or declared themselves emperor.</p>
<h2>Roleplay, IC/OOC, and Not Being <i>That</i> Guy</h2>
<p>Goobstation runs both LRP (Low Roleplay) and MRP (Medium Roleplay) servers. On MRP, staying in character is expected. On LRP, you can get away with more, but "random murderhobo" is still not a valid character arc.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IC (In Character):</strong> Everything your character says and does in-game. Stick to the station reality—don’t reference Discord, real life, or previous rounds.</li>
  <li><strong>OOC (Out of Character):</strong> For everything else. Don’t use OOC chat to spoil the round, argue about rules, or call out antagonists.</li>
  <li><strong>Metagaming:</strong> Using knowledge your character wouldn’t plausibly have (e.g., secret antag locations, round events, Discord leaks) is forbidden.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re new to roleplay, don’t overthink it. Speak and act as if you really worked on a dangerous, underfunded space station. Respect your coworkers (unless you’re the Clown — then you have plausible deniability).</p>
<h3>Roleplay Tips</h3>
<p>Greet people. Roleplay mundane tasks. React to situations as your character, not as a player with a bird’s-eye view.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what’s appropriate, err on the side of caution. It’s better to be a little boring than banned.</p>
<p>Most importantly: Make the round fun for yourself and others. That includes not derailing everyone else’s shift for your own amusement.</p>
<h2>Antagonists &amp; Escalation: The Fun (and the Rules) of Trouble</h2>
<p>Each round, some players are picked to be Antagonists ("antags"). Their role is to shake things up: maybe sabotage, maybe murder, maybe just annoy everyone. If you want to be an antag, opt-in during character setup.</p>
<p>Not all antags are violent. Some have objectives like theft, sabotage, or spreading chaos without outright murder. Don’t assume every weird action is an antag—sometimes people are just strange.</p>
<p>If you’re NOT an antag, don’t act like one. Do not take justice into your own hands unless you have a very good reason (and preferably backup from Security).</p>
<p>If you suspect someone is an antag: Notify Security, use in-game radio, or admin help ("ahelp"). Don’t start a toolbox duel in the hallways.</p>
<p>Killing other players "just because" is called RDM (Random Deathmatch) and will get you banned. Even as antag, mindless rampages usually end in a ban and/or admin intervention.</p>
<p>Remember: If you’re confused about what’s allowed, ask. Staff would rather clarify than issue bans.</p>
<h4>Common Antag Types</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Traitors:</strong> Have secret objectives. Not always killers — sometimes just need to steal a hat.</li>
  <li><strong>Revolutionaries:</strong> Try to turn crew against command. Expect chaos.</li>
  <li><strong>Nukies:</strong> Sometimes arrive to blow up the station. If you see people in red space suits, run.</li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Ask for help:</strong> Use radio, talk to colleagues, or try Discord (avoid spoiling the round)</li>
  <li><strong>Maps:</strong> Most stations have in-game maps; you’ll also find them on the wiki.</li>
  <li><strong>Slang:</strong> Confused? Check the <a href="https://wiki.goobstation.com/Slang">Slang</a> page. Space has a language of its own.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Survival and Sanity Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The fire extinguisher is your friend (and occasionally your weapon).</li>
  <li>Doors are smarter than they look. If you get locked in a room, check your access or call for help.</li>
  <li>Not everything is as it seems. If you see a monkey with a jetpack, think twice before approaching.</li>
  <li>Keep an eye on your health. If you’re injured, find Medical or ask someone to drag your corpse to Medbay.</li>
  <li>Don’t carry every tool in the station "just in case." Hoarding makes you a target, not a hero.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Good luck! Try not to get ejected into space, turned into a frog, or end up on the Clown’s next "prank" video during your first day. Remember: every shift is a new story — make it a good one, or at least a memorable disaster.</p>
