<p>Welcome to <strong>Goobstation</strong>! You and your fellow crewmembers are now proud employees of <a href="/Lore/Nanotrasen">Nanotrasen</a>, stationed aboard a <a href="/Maps">barely-functional orbital facility</a>. Your goal: do your job, survive your shift, and maybe have fun in the process.</p>

<h2>Before You Start</h2>
<ul>
  <li>📜 Read the <a href="/Rules/Rules">server rules</a>. Press <strong>F1</strong> in-game to review them at any time.</li>
  <li>❓ Lost or confused? Ask questions:
    <ul>
      <li>In-game, via <a href="/Radio">radio</a> or direct chat.</li>
      <li>On <a href="https://discord.gg/bpHJneTjUb">Discord</a> (#help channel; no spoilers).</li>
      <li>Or use <a href="/Ahelp"><i>Ahelp</i></a> for admin support (Escape → Admin Help).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>When you first join, you’ll pick (or be assigned) a <a href="/Roles">job</a>. Not sure what to choose? We recommend:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/Roles/Civilian/Passenger">Passenger</a> – You have no duties and zero responsibility. Perfect for learning controls and exploring.</li>
</ul>
<p>Set “Passenger” to high priority, all others to “Never”. Walk around, chat, rummage in your backpack, and maybe don’t stand next to explosives.</p>

<p>If you join late, wait at the arrivals shuttle. It’ll dock automatically and bring you aboard. Look for a map or follow the screaming.</p>

<h2>How to Not Get Banned Instantly</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do <strong>not</strong> kill, attack, or grief people unless you're an <a href="/Roles/Antagonist">Antagonist</a>.</li>
  <li>Do <strong>not</strong> break into secure areas or steal gear “for fun”.</li>
  <li>Do <strong>not</strong> use out-of-character (OOC) info in-character (IC), and vice versa. That's called <a href="/Rules/Rules#metagaming">metagaming</a>.</li>
  <li>Don’t be a jerk. You’re here to create fun for others, not just yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Is Roleplaying?</h2>
<p>You're playing a character. Stay in character (IC) at all times. Your crewmates are coworkers, not enemies. The station is your workplace, not your playground. Follow <a href="/Standard_Operating_Procedure">SOP</a> and act like you're part of the crew.</p>

<p>OOC means anything outside the game world: Discord, OOC chat, etc. Don’t talk about the current round there. Don’t act on info your character wouldn’t reasonably know.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>✅ Do</th><th>❌ Don’t</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay in character</li>
          <li>Talk to people, ask for help</li>
          <li>React as your character would</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Discuss the round in OOC</li>
          <li>Attack people without cause</li>
          <li>Use meta info to gain advantage</li>
        </ul>
      </td>

<h2>So You Want to Be Useful</h2>
<p>Once you know the controls, try:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/Roles/Service">Service jobs</a> – Like <a href="/Roles/Service/Bartender">Bartender</a>, <a href="/Roles/Service/Chef">Chef</a>, or <a href="/Roles/Service/Janitor">Janitor</a>. Great for roleplay and low risk.</li>
  <li><a href="/Roles/Cargo/Cargo_Technician">Cargo Technician</a> – Explore the station and deliver gear.</li>
  <li><a href="/Roles/Medical/Medical_Intern">Medical Intern</a>, <a href="/Roles/Engineering/Technical_Assistant">Technical Assistant</a>, or <a href="/Roles/Science/Research_Assistant">Research Assistant</a> – Shadow professionals and learn complex systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Antagonists and Chaos</h2>
<p>Some players are picked to be <a href="/Roles/Antagonist">Antagonists</a> – saboteurs, assassins, or worse. You can volunteer for these roles, but they're assigned randomly each round.</p>

<p>If you’re picked, you’ll see a message. Press <strong>C</strong> to check. If it says “Crew Aligned”, you’re not an antagonist. Don’t act like one.</p>

<p>Being an antagonist does <em>not</em> mean “go on a killing spree”. Follow your objectives. Be subtle, clever, or dramatic — but don’t ruin the round for everyone.</p>

<h3>How to React</h3>
<p>Suspect foul play? Contact <a href="/Roles/Security">Security</a>. Avoid vigilante justice unless you're certain. And remember: even antags deserve trials… unless they're nukies. Then all bets are off.</p>

<h3>Don't Self-Antag</h3>
<p>That means pretending to be a villain when you’re not one. Breaking into places, stealing gear, attacking crew, hoarding weapons — that’s <strong>not</strong> okay unless the game says you’re an antag. You’ll get banned.</p>

<h3>Still Unsure?</h3>
<p>Ask. We don’t bite. Unless we’re spiders. But then it's IC.</p>
