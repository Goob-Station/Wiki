<h1>Guide to Engineering</h1>
<p>This is a guide representing the fundamentals for a station engineer and technical assistant, and… well, the necessary steps not to get verbally abused by the entire station for incompetence. This does not delve into atmospherics.</p>

<h3>Rapid Construction Device (RCD)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Basics to Power Transportation and Storage</h2>
<p>This section discusses the types of power as well as transforming and storing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Voltage Groups and Transformation</h3>
<p>There represent 3 voltage groups of electricity: Low (LV), medium (MV), and high (HV).&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/lv_coil_bundle.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="/mv_coil_bundle.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="/hv_coil_bundle.png"></figure>
<p>(Combine the above into a single figure, bruh.)</p>
<p>It is to note, these wires are not directly interchangeable and need to be transformed. Doing so requires one of two machines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Substation (HV ↔ MV)</li>
  <li>APC (MV ↔ LV)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence, most machinery found on the station run on LV, whilst most of power production produces HV. Hence, the produced power needs to be transformed down for station use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Power Storage</h3>
<p>Substations and APCs buffer buffer a small amount of power. However, for storage of bulk power requires the use of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Power Generation Methods</h2>
<p>As of writing this guide, there are X main methods of generating power as engineering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solar panels</li>
  <li>Anti-matter engine (AME)</li>
  <li>Singularity</li>
  <li>Tesla</li>
  <li>Thermo-electric generator (TEG)</li>
  <li>Super-matter crystal</li>
  <li>Portable generators</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Recommended Procedure</h2>
<p>With all your found information, you find yourself pondering what to do next (or you're just confused). Here's a basic list of things to do to make sure power stays operational.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Power Transmission Laser</h2>
<p>Device turns power (HV) into spesos by shooting lasers pulses into space. WARNING, DO NOT GO IN FRONT OF THE LASER AS IT FIRES. Currently, the generation of money can be represented below:</p>
