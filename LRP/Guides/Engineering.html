<h1>Guide to Engineering</h1>
<p>This is a guide representing the fundamentals for a station engineer and technical assistant, and… well, the necessary steps not to get verbally abused by the entire station for incompetence. This does not delve into atmospherics.</p>

<h3>Rapid Construction Device (RCD)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Basics to Power Transportation and Storage</h2>
<p>This section discusses the types of power as well as transforming and storing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Voltage Groups and Transformation</h3>
<p>There represent 3 voltage groups of electricity: Low (LV), medium (MV), and high (HV).&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/lv_coil_bundle.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="/mv_coil_bundle.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="/hv_coil_bundle.png"></figure>
<p>(Combine the above into a single figure, bruh.)</p>
<p>It is to note, these wires are not directly interchangeable and need to be transformed. Doing so requires one of two machines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Substation (HV ↔ MV)</li>
  <li>APC (MV ↔ LV)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence, most machinery found on the station run on LV, whilst most of power production produces HV. Hence, the produced power needs to be transformed down for station use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Power Storage</h3>
<p>Substations and APCs buffer buffer a small amount of power. However, for storage of bulk power requires the use of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Power Generation Methods</h2>
<p>As of writing this guide, there are X main methods of generating power as engineering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solar panels</li>
  <li>Anti-matter engine (AME)</li>
  <li>Singularity</li>
  <li>Tesla</li>
  <li>Thermo-electric generator (TEG)</li>
  <li>Super-matter crystal</li>
  <li>Portable generators</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Solar Panels</h3>
<p>Solar panels are source of passive energy on the station requiring minimal maintenance. Typically, they are used to supplement power generations for higher producing methods such as the tesla or singularity.</p>
<p>(ICON OF SOLAR PANELS)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solar panels produce HV power, scaling based on their relative angle to the sun.&nbsp;The orientation of the sun changes over time and can be thought of as “orbiting the station”. Panels can be automatically adjusted to face the sun using a Solar Tracker and Solar Control Computer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most situations, solar trackers are already present on the station. However, they require HV connection to the power network to function. Once set up, interacting with a Solar Control Computer allows you to see the sun's orientation. Additionally, it allows you to input both the solar angle and velocity. The speed of the sun's rotation is randomized each shift, hence, you will be required to iterate to match the solar rotational velocity to that of the sun's. First, set the velocity to 5.5 as an initial guess as well as matching the solar angle to that of the sun. If you see the solar angle lag behind, increase their velocity. If you see them exceed the sun's angle, decrease their velocity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solar panels are able to be upgraded using 2 plasma or uranium glass.&nbsp;At max each solar panel produces roughly:</p>

<p>Solar panels are able to be upgraded using plasma or uranium glass. To do so:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use a crowbar on the solar panel.</li>
  <li>Place the 2 of the desired panel material onto the machine.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each station has solar panels present in an one or more arrays. They are typically named “Solars” on the station map or their location can be viewed on a Power Monitoring Console. However, they are not automatically set up, requiring HV wiring to the station power network, and alignment to the sun. This wiring also includes the solar tracker, typically found on nearby each array. &nbsp;Some solar panels may be broken, requiring the removal and repair of the broken glass in the machine. This is accomplished via the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use a crowbar on the machine. This will eject 1-2 broken glass shards.</li>
  <li>Place two glass sheets into the solar panel. You can also weld the broken glass shards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can be ordered from cargo for $1250, containing 10 solar assembly flatpacks and 20 glass sheets. Once you place the assembly flatpack in an appropriate spot, use a multitool on it to unpack it. It is automatically anchored on the ground and requires 2 glass (or other panel material) to be placed inside it to be functional.</p>
