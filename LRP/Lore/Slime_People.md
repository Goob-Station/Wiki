# Slime People
Slime people, as they've called it, are a gooey and slimy species from the planet "Nyrithria". Comprising mostly out of a non-Newtonian, silicate based stem cell liquid. Surprisingly still containing a rigid internal structure, as well as a self confined shape that resemble standard humanoid with bipedal legs, 2 arms, and opposable thumbs.

They're still composed of basic organs like most other species and breathe in nitrogen (N2), expelling nitrous oxide (N2O) in the process. Their blood has a denser nutrient content than most, (though not recommended) and can be consumed as an alternative source of food.
