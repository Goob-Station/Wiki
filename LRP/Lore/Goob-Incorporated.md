# Goob Incorporated – A NanoTrasen Subsidiary
Goob Incorporated (GOOB, formally: Galactic Operations & Orbital Biosystems) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NanoTrasen, originally formed in 2322 from a bizarre and largely bureaucratic merger between:

- Galactic Operations, Ltd., a now-defunct contractor responsible for station scaffolding and exo-structural engineering,
- Orbital Biosystems, a minor biotech startup with marginally successful cloning patents,
- And the Bureau of Nutritional Edibles, a colonial food safety agency accidentally absorbed into the merger due to a clerical misrouting of asset codes.

The resulting organisation retained all letters of the merged companies in its official registration, forming the abbreviation G.O.O.B., or "Goob." Though the acronym was initially intended to be phased out, it gained traction among station personnel and stuck — much to the dismay of marketing executives.

## Station 14 and the Legacy of Goob Inc.
Goob Inc. was awarded a mid-scale orbital station contract as part of a NanoTrasen “Diversity in Development” initiative — a failed attempt to delegate low-priority frontier stations to subsidiaries to test modular design philosophies and "experimental staffing practices." Space Station 14 was the fourteenth in the series and one of the few to remain semi-operational after its initial year.

Built on a budget half that of its predecessor and staffed by a mix of cloned interns, repurposed maintenance bots, and at least one reanimated VP, Station 14 quickly earned a reputation for “questionable operational coherence.” Yet, against all odds — and multiple explosions — it remained active. Goob’s engineers were quick to patch flaws, and its biosystems division, while underqualified, successfully installed the first experimental "autonomous hydroponics array" (which later became self-aware and unionised).

Eventually, NanoTrasen reabsorbed Station 14 into its mainline operations after Goob Inc. filed for internal bankruptcy (a legal status unique to NanoTrasen subsidiaries, in which a company ceases to exist while continuing to operate under observation). However, the name “Goob Station” stuck with its inhabitants — even as official documents insisted on simply 'SS14'.

Goob Inc. is still listed in various databases, often flagged for “pending audit,” “noncompliant organ disposal,” or “HR incident, unresolved.” Its legacy survives in poorly-labeled documentation, scattered infrastructure modules still marked “GOOB PROPERTY – DO NOT SCRAP,” and a suspiciously sticky vending machine firmware.
While NanoTrasen no longer publicly advertises Goob Inc., its name lives on as a cautionary tale in NT corporate training modules: "Avoid Goobification – Consolidate Your Divisions Properly."

# CEO of Goob Inc.: Dr. Kira Bostitch
Full Name: Dr. Kira Bostitch
Position: Chief Executive Officer of Goob Incorporated (Galactic Operations & Orbital Biosystems)
Titles: "Doctor" (self-awarded), “Chief Facilitator of Progress”

#### Background
Dr. Bostitch is a former nutritional data analyst turned biotech evangelist who rose to prominence during the early days of Goob Inc.’s formation. He was originally part of the Bureau of Nutritional Edibles — specifically, their Lunar Paste Texture Compliance Division — and somehow became an executive during the paperwork chaos of the merger and a spectacular budgeting error.

Possessing no formal degrees but a printed PhD from a now-defunct Martian diploma mill (“Oxford of the Stars”), Dr. Bostitch is widely considered a walking HR violation. His leadership style is described as a mixture of corporate optimism, scientific misunderstanding, and complete disregard for cause-and-effect.

Dr. Bostitch technically still holds the title of CEO, but his physical whereabouts are uncertain. Some reports claim he uploaded his consciousness into an executive fax machine. Others say he lives inside a cloned monkey on Station 14. Regardless, his signature continues to appear on Goob contracts and requisition forms — suggesting he is either alive, a distributed algorithm, or too bureaucratically entangled to be declared dead.
