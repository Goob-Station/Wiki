| Icon | Cost | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![](/kardashev-mosin.png) | 4 TC | Surplus Rifle | A bolt action service rifle that has seen many wars. Not modern by any standard, hand loaded, and terrible recoil, but it is cheap. |
| ![](/energy_dagger.png) | 10 TC | Energy Dagger | A small energy blade conveniently disguised in the form of a pen. |
| ![](/viper.png) | 14 TC | Viper | A small, easily concealable, but somewhat underpowered gun. Retrofitted with a fully automatic receiver. Uses pistol magazines (.35 auto). |
| ![](/cobra.png) | 15 TC | Cobra | A rugged, robust operator handgun with inbuilt silencer. Uses pistol magazines (.25 caseless). |
| ![](/energy_shield.png) | 15 TC | Energy Shield | Exotic energy shield that reflects all laser beams and offers a little protection from bullets and other physical attacks. It is discharged from received damage and is able to recharge automatically. Warning: EMP pulses are able to discharge energy shield internal battery. |
| ![](/python.png) | 20 TC | Python | A brutally simple, effective, and loud Syndicate revolver. Comes loaded with armor-piercing rounds. Uses .45 magnum. |
| ![](/throwing_knives_kit.png) | 20 TC | Throwing Knives Kit | A set of 4 syndicate branded throwing knives, perfect for embedding into the body of your victims. |
| ![](/syndicate_crate.png) | 25 TC | Syndicate Bulk Rifle Crate | 10 WW4-era rifles to arm you, your friends, and your cat. Saves 40% on shipping costs by buying in bulk. |
| ![](/electrical_toolbox.png) | 30 TC | Disposable Ballistic Turret | Looks and functions like a normal electrical toolbox. Upon hitting the toolbox it will transform into a ballistic turret, theoretically shooting at anyone except members of the syndicate. Can be turned back into a toolbox using a screwdriver and repaired using a wrench. |
| ![](/contractor_baton.png) | 35 TC | Contractor Baton | A compact, specialised baton assigned to Syndicate contractors. Applies light electrical shocks to targets. These shocks are capable of affecting the inner circuitry of most robots as well, applying a short stun. |
| ![](/energy_sword.png) | 37 TC | Energy Sword | A very dangerous energy sword that can reflect energy shots. Can be stored in pockets when turned off. Makes a lot of noise when used or turned on. |
| ![](/anaconda.png) | 40 TC | Anaconda | The pride of the Cybersun arms concern, this heavy pistol is designed to feed itself with the built-in fabricator. |
| ![](/betrayal_knife.png) | 40 TC | Betrayal Knife | Betrayal knife allows the user to blink a short distance, knocking down people in a small radius around blink position. Deals significant damage when target is lying down or facing away from you. Use it in your hand to toggle blink mode. |
| ![](/gloves_of_the_north_star.png) | 40 TC | Gloves of the North Star | A pair of gloves that reduce your punching cooldown drastically, allowing you to beat people to death in a flurry of punches. |
