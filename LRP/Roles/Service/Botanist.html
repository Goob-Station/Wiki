<h1>Botanist</h1>
<p><i>Your mind tingles. The plants speak to you. You already know what you must do.</i><br><i>Grow.</i><br><i>And Plant.</i><br><i>Until it is done.</i></p>
<p>The Botanist is a service role under management of the Head of Personnel (HoP). Sometimes called Hydroponics, Hydro, Botany, or Bot, the Botanist's job is to grow plants and distribute produce to the station. All members of the crew may request items from Botany, though as a Botanist, you are not <i>required</i> to oblige their requests. The most common departments that request items are the Kitchen and Chemistry, with occasional visits from Epistemics and Cargo. Ranging from traditional produce you might find at your local NanoTrasen grocery store to mutated vegetables that will just kill you, the Botanist is equipped with all the jobs for the job.</p>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<p>To first become a good Botanist, one must first understand the tools of the Trade. Nanotrasen provides basic tools within the Nutrimax Vending Machine, all of which are useful in it's own way.&nbsp;</p>
