<h1>Botanist</h1>
<p><i>Your mind tingles. The plants speak to you. You already know what you must do.</i><br><i>Grow.</i><br><i>And Plant.</i><br><i>Until it is done.</i></p>
<p>The Botanist is a service role under management of the Head of Personnel (HoP). Sometimes called Hydroponics, Hydro, Botany, or Bot, the Botanist's job is to grow plants and distribute produce to the station. All members of the crew may request items from Botany, though as a Botanist, you are not <i>required</i> to oblige their requests. The most common departments that request items are the Kitchen and Chemistry, with occasional visits from Epistemics and Cargo. Ranging from traditional produce you might find at your local NanoTrasen grocery store to mutated vegetables that will just kill you, the Botanist is equipped with all the jobs for the job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<p>To first become a good Botanist, one must first understand the tools of the Trade. Nanotrasen provides basic tools within the Nutrimax Vending Machine, all of which are useful in it's own way.&nbsp;</p>

Diona's may use Robust Harvests as a “discount” Omnizine, healing nearly all forms of common blunt damage.&nbsp;</td>

Caution must be exercised when utilizing Unstable Mutagens, as mutations may render plants unviable or seedless, as well as turning it into Kudzu. Bug your local chemist for Unstable Mutagens.</td>

<h3>NT-Guide to a Robust Botanist</h3>
<p>In order to fully maximize your potential as an aspiring Botanist, you must always remember that mutations and swabbing are always random. You may not get what trait or chemicals you wish within a shift, and that is okay. Below is an example of “Medical-Maxxing”, which includes an example of swabbing.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Bug your Chemist for Mutagens and Phalaximine. It should take them only a few minutes to mix everything. Make sure to always bring TWO buckets from the Nutrivend before you do, so that your chemist won't be giving away their precious beakers.</li>
  <li>Plant Ambrosia Vulgaris, taking the seeds from the MegaSeed Vendor. Dose each Vulgaris tray with 5u Unstable Mutagen each.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Remove any Vulgaris that mutate into Kudzu. If your Vulgaris mutates into an Ambrosia Deus, immediately swab the Deus. Should the Deus be Unviable, dose the Hydroponic Tray with 5u of Phalaximine.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Swab the Deus.</li>
  <li>Plant apples. Dose each apple plant with 5u each of Unstable Mutagens.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Repeat step 3 for each of the apples. Should your apples mutate into Golden Apples, remove all other apple trees unless the crew asks for apples.</li>
  <li>Make sure to clip and plant a “Control” Golden Apple tree. This will be your backup. You may also wait for the Golden Apple tree to flower and extract seeds from the Golden Apples.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Using the now unsterile swab with pollen from the Deus plant, carefully swab and dust the Golden Apple tree.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Using your Plant Analyzer, make sure the Golden Apple has the following chemicals at minimum: Doctor's Delight and Omnizine. Should the apples no longer produce seeds, add Sedin.</li>
  <li>Grow two Towercap shrooms. Swab the Omnizine and Doctor's Delight apples to the Towercap shrooms. Should the Towercaps no longer have 5 flowers, utilize a new swab to move the 5 flower trait back to the Doctor's Delight and Omnizine Towercaps. The seedless trait should be ignored as it can be easily fixed.</li>
  <li>Should luck favor you and all prior steps are done correctly, swab the now 5-flower Omnizine and Doctor's Delight Towercaps back to the Golden Apple tree.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Congratulations. You have now acquired a 5-flower Omnizine and Doctor's Delight Golden Apple. You may utilize additional Mutagens or Robust Harvests to increase flower size.&nbsp;</li>
