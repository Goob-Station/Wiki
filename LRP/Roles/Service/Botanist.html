<h1>Botanist</h1>
<p><i>Your mind tingles. The plants speak to you. You already know what you must do.</i><br><i>Grow.</i><br><i>And Plant.</i><br><i>Until it is done.</i></p>
<p>The Botanist is a service role under management of the Head of Personnel (HoP). Sometimes called Hydroponics, Hydro, Botany, or Bot, the Botanist's job is to grow plants and distribute produce to the station. All members of the crew may request items from Botany, though as a Botanist, you are not <i>required</i> to oblige their requests. The most common departments that request items are the Kitchen and Chemistry, with occasional visits from Epistemics and Cargo. Ranging from traditional produce you might find at your local NanoTrasen grocery store to mutated vegetables that will just kill you, the Botanist is equipped with all the jobs for the job.</p>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<p>To first become a good Botanist, one must first understand the tools of the Trade. Nanotrasen provides basic tools within the Nutrimax Vending Machine, all of which are useful in it's own way.&nbsp;</p>

        <td>The most important tool of any good Botanist's arsenal, it displays the stats of a hydroponic tray and it's plant. Useful for obtaining information on whether or not it's missing any of its core components like water or nutrients or is suffering from weeds or poison. Additionally, also displays useful information on plant's name, age, and health, alongside what chemicals it contains.</td>

        <td>Robust Harvest</td>
        <td>Robust Harvest, a dark brown chemical that greatly enhances a plant's flower size, at the cost of it's seed capabilities. Can be obtained from the Nutri-vend. Can increase flower sizes up the Gigantic, after which obscene amounts of Robust Harvests are needed to increase its size further. Diona's may use Robust Harvests as a “discount” Omnizine, healing nearly all forms of common blunt damage.&nbsp;</td>

        <td>The most essential chemical within a Botanist's arsenal. Randomly mutates genes of a plant, randomly changing any part of the plant, ranging from flower size, flower count, any of the mutated traits, as well as mutating the plant into a new variant. Caution must be exercised when utilizing Unstable Mutagens, as mutations may render plants unviable or seedless, as well as turning it into Kudzu. Bug your local chemist for Unstable Mutagens.</td>

        <td>Sedin is a niche chemical that allows a plant to regain it's seeds from produce, allowing seeds to be extracted from it's produce. However, this comes at the cost of decreasing plant flower size. Best used in small units, and is heavily recommended to use 1u at a time. Bug your local chemist for Sedin.&nbsp;</td>

        <td>The second most essential chemical within a Botanist's arsenal. Poisons the plant when used but removes the “death gene” or “unviability” from the plant. This allows the plant to grow again and not continuously lose health over time. Bug your local chemist for Phalaximine atop of the traditional Unstable Mutagens.</td>

        <td>An innocuous swab capable of marvelous things. Sterile Swabs are capable of transfer plant traits and chemicals to other plants, allowing exceptionally robust Botanists to transfer highly sought after chemicals, like Omnizine, into other plants. Remember the golden rule of Sterility; if you don't remember if you had swabbed it, <strong>THROW IT OUT</strong>.</td>
