<h2>Role Overview: Cleaning, Chaos, and Quiet Heroism</h2>
<p>The Janitor is the unsung backbone of the station. Though part of the Service department, your work spans the entire facility — corridors, engineering bays, bars, and sometimes crime scenes. Your job sounds simple: keep the station clean, functional, and safe. In practice, it’s a juggling act of vigilance, creative problem-solving, and quiet resilience. You’ll be blamed for other people’s messes and praised only by absence.</p>
<p>Janitors mop floors, replace lights, remove graffiti, and haul away trash. But you'll also erase evidence, discover corpses, and intervene in the wake of clown-induced disasters. A well-timed mop swing or perfectly placed sign can mean the difference between order and chaos.</p>
<h2>Starting Out: Your First Shift</h2>
<h3>The Janitor’s Closet: Home Base</h3>
<p>On spawn, make your way to the Janitor’s Closet to gather your gear. It contains:</p>

        <th>A vending machine for janitorial clothing. Use it by clicking on the machine, then select the item you want from the menu (e.g., gloves, winter coat). Does <strong>not</strong> dispense galoshes, so protect your starting pair.</th>

When all the clean water in it gets dirty, drag it to a Drain, often found in your closet, and click and drag the Mop Bucket onto the Drain to empty it. You can then refill it at a water tank, sink, or water cooler using a Bucket or other small container to transfer water. Be warned, as anyone can tip over your Mop Bucket given a little time, which will more than likely make a horrendous mess for you to clean.&nbsp;</th>

        <th>
          <p>The classic cleaning tool for any self-respecting Janitor. Used to clean floor puddles or bludgeon hostile Xenofauna.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Usage<strong>:</strong> Left-click on a container filled with water (e.g., Mop Bucket or Trolley) to wet the mop. Then, left-click on a puddle one or more times until it's replaced with clean water, which evaporates over time. If a puddle is under a table or chair, right-click the tile and select the puddle manually.</li>
            <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Once the mop is saturated (the liquid bar is filled with mess), return to a bucket to wring and rewet it. If the mop doesn’t absorb water, the Mop Bucket needs a refill.</li>
            <li><strong>Combat Use:</strong> Press Z to wield it as a two-handed weapon. Surprisingly effective when dealing with pests — or uncooperative crew.</li>

            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Requires multiple buckets to fully fill an empty Mop Bucket.</li>
            <li><strong>Style Bonus:</strong> Empty buckets can be worn on your head. Morale-boosting. Maybe.</li>

<h2>Daily Duties</h2>
<h3>Core Responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mopping:</strong> Use mop and water to remove puddles—blood, lube, vomit, whatever it is Science left behind. Replace dirty water frequently.</li>
  <li><strong>Graffiti Removal:</strong> Spray and mop offensive or out-of-place graffiti. Consider artistic merit first—especially mime art.</li>
  <li><strong>Trash Collection:</strong> Use trash bags for loose garbage. Use the trash cart for bulk jobs. Encourage proper bin usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Light Replacement:</strong> Fix burnt-out lights using the Light Replacer and bulbs/tubes.</li>
  <li><strong>Wet Floor Sign Deployment:</strong> Always mark wet areas before mopping. Most will ignore it—but you’ll be in the clear.</li>
  <li><strong>Side Jobs:</strong> Unclog toilets, place traps, clean debris from fights, or help after explosions. Expect variety.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Responding to Requests</h3>
<p>Stay tuned to your Service radio. Departments will ping you for cleanups.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Medbay:</strong> Blood and biohazards. Clean quickly and unobtrusively.</li>
  <li><strong>Science:</strong> Unidentified fluids, spills, and residue.</li>
  <li><strong>Bar:</strong> Drinks, vomit, smashed glasses—standard chaos.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Late Shifts &amp; Emergencies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If joining late: gear up fast, the station is probably a mess.</li>
  <li>During emergencies: clear main paths, handle blood spills, dispose of bodies or hazards if Medbay is overwhelmed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced Cleaning: Going Beyond the Mop</h2>
<h3>Expanding Your Role</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Know the Station:</strong> Learn paths, maintenance tunnels, and department layouts.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource Redistribution:</strong> Deliver steel, glass, or cloth from salvage to departments that need it.</li>
  <li><strong>Dead Animals:</strong> Give to the Chef or Cargo for processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Use the Recycler:</strong> Keep your rounds clean and profitable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Salvage Operations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Crowbar:</strong> For opening doors when power fails.</li>
  <li><strong>Wrench/Screwdriver:</strong> Unbolt and move furniture, racks, or light fixtures. Useful for material recovery.</li>
  <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Trade scrap for goodwill or tools. Build alliances with Engineers, Quartermasters, or Scientists.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hazard Awareness</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Crime Scenes:</strong> Do not clean blood or evidence without clearance from Security.</li>
  <li><strong>Dangerous Fluids:</strong> If you don’t know what it is — don’t touch it. Ping Science or Security.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-Defense:</strong> Use your mop as a weapon if needed (Z to wield). Surprisingly effective.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices &amp; Survival Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Always wear galoshes.</li>
  <li>Don’t hoard. Share or recycle surplus.</li>
  <li>Label dangerous areas with signage.</li>
  <li>Prioritize major corridors and Arrivals.</li>
  <li>Help lost crewmates or drag wounded to Medbay.</li>
  <li>Clean before someone slips. Clean <i>after</i> someone slips.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Supporting the Crew</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Assist Medbay by removing blood or cleaning treatment rooms.</li>
  <li>Provide Engineering with salvage.</li>
  <li>Alert Security to suspicious finds (e.g., bloody knives, bodies).</li>
  <li>Help maintain public areas like the Bar, Arrivals, and Bridge access.</li>
  <li>In chaos, be the one clearing paths, guiding people, and keeping morale high through order.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Janitorial Code &amp; Station Culture</h2>
<h3>Ethics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t remove evidence without cause.</li>
  <li>Don’t erase meaningful art unless necessary.</li>
  <li>Don’t escalate clown rivalry unless you're ready to commit.</li>
  <li>Ask questions. Learn from older janitors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Roleplay Hooks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Build a janitorial persona — silent guardian, proud custodian, mop-wielding monk.</li>
  <li>Narrate your cleaning or speak in slogans.</li>
  <li>Establish janitorial territory.</li>
  <li>Rival or ally with the Clown, HoP, or AI.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Legend of the Janitor</h2>
<p>Great Janitors become myths. They’re whispered about — cleaners who never miss a puddle, who maintain Arrivals during a cult round, who wield a mop like a claymore. If nobody knows your name but the floors are always gleaming, you’ve done it right.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Nobody thanks the Janitor when the station is clean — but everyone complains when it isn’t. You are unthanked, unarmed, and often unnoticed — but essential.</p>
<p>Clean with pride. Clean with purpose. And never underestimate the power of a wet floor sign.</p>
