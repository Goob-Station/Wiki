<h2>Role Overview: Cleaning, Chaos, and Quiet Heroism</h2>
<p>Janitors are members of the Service department — and guardians of basic hygiene on an otherwise chaotic space station. While the rest of the crew drowns in paperwork, science experiments, or each other’s blood, you quietly restore order with soap, mops, and passive aggression. Your work keeps the station safe, clean, and vaguely respectable.</p>
<p>You mop floors, scrub graffiti, replace lights, collect trash, and often clean up evidence of foul play. Sometimes you’re the first responder. Sometimes you’re the last to leave. Most of the time, you’re the one everyone blames when they slip.</p>
<h2>Your First Shift</h2>
<h3>Equipment &amp; Starting Area</h3>
<p>After spawning, head to the Janitor’s Closet to collect your supplies. Here’s what you’ll find:</p>

        <th>JaniDrobe</th>
        <th>A vending machine for janitorial clothing. Use it by clicking on the machine, then select the item you want from the menu (e.g., gloves, winter coat). Does <strong>not</strong> dispense galoshes, so protect your starting pair.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
        <th>Janitorial Trolley</th>
        <th>A large rolling cart for your main cleaning gear. You can add/remove items (mop, bucket, plunger, trash bag, spray, etc). Slower and bulkier than a mop bucket, but it holds more and can serve as portable storage.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
        <th>Mop Bucket</th>
        <th>Pull with you by pressing <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Mouse Left</strong>. Make sure it's full of water before heading out for cleaning duty. When all the clean water in it gets dirty, drag it to a Drain, often found in your closet, and click and drag the Mop Bucket onto the Drain to empty it. You can then refill it at a water tank, sink, or water cooler using a Bucket or other small container to transfer water. Be warned, as anyone can tip over your Mop Bucket given a little time, which will more than likely make a horrendous mess for you to clean.&nbsp;</th>

        <th><strong>Mop</strong></th>
        <th>
          <p>The classic cleaning tool for any self-respecting Janitor. Used to clean floor puddles or bludgeon hostile Xenofauna.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Usage<strong>:</strong> Left-click on a container filled with water (e.g., Mop Bucket or Trolley) to wet the mop. Then, left-click on a puddle one or more times until it's replaced with clean water, which evaporates over time. If a puddle is under a table or chair, right-click the tile and select the puddle manually.</li>
            <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Once the mop is saturated (the liquid bar is filled with mess), return to a bucket to wring and rewet it. If the mop doesn’t absorb water, the Mop Bucket needs a refill.</li>
            <li><strong>Combat Use:</strong> Press Z to wield it as a two-handed weapon. Surprisingly effective when dealing with pests — or uncooperative crew.</li>

            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Requires multiple buckets to fully fill an empty Mop Bucket.</li>
            <li><strong>Style Bonus:</strong> Empty buckets can be worn on your head. Morale-boosting. Maybe.</li>

<h2>Core Duties: Keeping It Clean</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mop floors:</strong> Clean up water, blood, vomit, or lube puddles. Watch your mop water — contaminated water just spreads filth.</li>
  <li><strong>Scrub graffiti:</strong> Use spray and mop to remove unwanted art. Think twice before scrubbing mime masterpieces — they may take offense.</li>
  <li><strong>Collect trash:</strong> Trash Bag for routine garbage, Trash Cart for larger hauls. Encourage crew to use bins, but be prepared to do it yourself.</li>
  <li><strong>Replace lights:</strong> Load light replacer with bulbs/tubes, click broken fixtures to replace. Bad lighting means accidents (and more work for you).</li>
  <li><strong>Set wet floor signs:</strong> Always warn before you mop — keeps you safe from lawsuits, even if nobody else cares.</li>
  <li><strong>Odd jobs:</strong> Unclog toilets, trap vermin, clear debris from fights, and be first on the scene after Science “learns something new.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Responding to Requests</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Listen to your department radio. Expect calls for cleanup in Medical, Bar, and Science. Fast response makes you popular (or at least less hated).</li>
  <li>Medbay: Blood everywhere. Clean, mop, restock supplies.</li>
  <li>Science: Watch for new chemicals, biohazards, or things that weren’t here a minute ago.</li>
  <li>Bar: Spilled drinks, vomit, and maybe a brawl or two. Quick mop, fresh glassware.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Late Shifts &amp; Emergencies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you join late, grab supplies quickly. Expect the station to be a mess.</li>
  <li>During mass emergencies (explosions, depressurizations), focus on clearing safe paths and disposing of biohazards.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mastering Janitoring: Advanced Strategies &amp; Station Ecology</h2>
<h3>Making Yourself Useful</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your rounds take you everywhere — learn the station layout, shortcuts, and maintenance tunnels.</li>
  <li>Dead animals? Give them to the Chef (for cooking) or Cargo (for profit).</li>
  <li>Raw materials (glass, plastic, steel, wood): Haul to Science or Engineering, or sell/distribute via Cargo. You’re a vital link in the station’s supply chain.</li>
  <li>Process all trash via the Recycler when possible. The less junk, the safer and more efficient the station.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Salvage and Upcycling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A crowbar lets you access unpowered doors — essential during power failures or for cleaning abandoned sectors.</li>
  <li>Wrench and screwdriver let you move racks, unbolt lockers, or salvage abandoned furniture. Engineering and Science appreciate free materials.</li>
  <li>Advanced Janitors build a network — trade scrap for favors, supplies, or goodwill with other departments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hazards and Caution</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Never clean up active crime scenes without Security approval. Evidence matters — unless you want to be an accomplice.</li>
  <li>Identify dangerous spills (lube, plasma, unknown chemicals). Only clean if safe. Call Science or Security if in doubt.</li>
  <li>If attacked, wield your mop (press Z) as a weapon. You’re surprisingly dangerous when provoked.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pro Tips &amp; Janitor Lore</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Always keep your galoshes on.</strong> No exceptions. If you lose them, find or request a replacement immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t over-collect.</strong> Hoarding trash bags full of random junk annoys Cargo, Security, and Engineering alike.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice crowd control.</strong> Set wet floor signs before you mop high-traffic areas—expect people to ignore them.</li>
  <li><strong>Janitor’s intuition:</strong> Expect the unexpected — sometimes you’ll be the first to discover a body, a fire, or an outbreak. Report and move on.</li>
  <li><strong>Mop as a tool and weapon:</strong> Use it for defense in a pinch, or for bludgeoning pests (sometimes including the Clown).</li>
  <li><strong>Be ready to improvise.</strong> Power outages, mass gibbings, and sabotage will make routine cleaning impossible. Prioritize: keep key hallways, Medbay, and Arrivals clear.</li>
  <li><strong>Help others.</strong> Deliver lost property, clean blood to aid Medbay, provide extra materials to Engineering. It builds goodwill.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Helping the Station: Beyond Cleanliness</h2>
<p>Your role supports everyone else. Here’s how to maximize your positive impact:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proactively visit departments — ask if anyone needs a mess cleaned or supplies delivered.</li>
  <li>Coordinate with Cargo for supply restocks or waste collection.</li>
  <li>Alert Security to suspicious finds (weapons, strange chemicals, bodies in Maintenance).</li>
  <li>Help Engineering by clearing blocked areas, reporting broken lights, or providing raw materials.</li>
  <li>In emergencies, help guide panicked crew to exits by keeping critical corridors clear.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Janitorial Ethics and Etiquette</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t intentionally clean up evidence unless it’s part of the fun (or you want to antagonize Security).</li>
  <li>Respect artists — some graffiti is morale boosting, some is evidence, some is just a mime’s magnum opus.</li>
  <li>Don’t compete with the Clown for pranks unless you want an escalation.</li>
  <li>New Janitors: Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Experienced players are often happy to teach you optimal cleaning routes, equipment tricks, or shortcuts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Station Legends: The Janitor as Urban Myth</h2>
<p>There’s a quiet dignity in Janitor work. Some see you as a background character; others as a stealthy hero. Veteran Janitors become legends — known for never letting blood puddle for more than a minute, or for discovering half the station’s mysteries before Security arrives. The cleanest stations are often the work of one obsessive, methodical Janitor.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: In Praise of the Unsung Hero</h2>
<p>Nobody will thank you for a spotless station, but everyone will notice if you stop. Wear your galoshes with pride — the fate of the station’s shoes (and morale) rests with you. Even when nobody’s watching, you make the station livable. In the chaos of Goobstation, that’s a superpower in itself</p>
