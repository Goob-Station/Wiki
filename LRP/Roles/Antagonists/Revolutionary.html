<h2>How to convert</h2>
<p>To convert other crew to your side you must use your Manifesto by clicking on crew near by to you, do note that there is a short progress bar.</p>
<p>Remember Security and Command start with a mindshield. If A crew member has a mindshield they can not be converted, to bypass this you can use your fast draw implanter to remove their mindshield.</p>
