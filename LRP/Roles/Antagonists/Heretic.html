<h2>The <b>Heretic</b></h2>
 
<p>"Forgotten, devoured, gutted. Humanity has forgotten the eldritch forces of decay, but the mansus veil has weakened. We will make them taste fear again..."
  <br>
  Another day, another meaningless shift of working... until you find a higher meaning! The Mansus reaches out to you, and you see the truth in the outer gods. It's now time for you to help them by ascending to demi-godhood... or by refusing ascension and wreacking havok on all the non-belivers that you can get your hands on.</p>

    <h1 id="The_Mansus_Veil_Weakens"><b>The Mansus Veil Weakens</b></h1>

    <p>Now that you've been chosen, you must first understand what these gods are offering for you.
  	The Mansus is a complicated place, and what they kindly gave you already isn't gonna cut it for what you have in mind.
  	Be aware, heretics are one of, if not, the hardest antagonist to master. You will need to be robust both in combat
  	and in general knowledge of the game. That said, don't be afraid to try being one! Trial and error is how the ones
  	that ascend managed to learn it too!</p>
    &nbsp;
    <h2 id="The_Research_Of_Knowledge"><b>The Research Of Knowledge</b></h2>

    <p>The main way of getting power for an heretic is unlocking more rituals and abilities with knowledge points,
  		which can be obtained in plenty of ways, other than a free point every 20 minutes.</p>

  <p>First and foremost, you'll be looking for <b>reality shifts</b> around the station.
      These cannot be seen by non-heretics until harvested, where they become reality fractures.
  	  Once harvested, they will give you one point, or two if done with an open Codex Cicatrix,
      made from a pen, a piece of meat and a book;
      be careful with taking too long making a Codex however, as other heretics can take those fractures before you do!
  		Security isn't allowed to treat fractures as a confirmation of heretic, so don't worry. Your cover is safe.</p>

    <p>Another way is the <b>ritual of knowledge</b>, requiring you four random items from a long list; 
       you'll have to buy it for one point but when done, it will give you five back.
  		 You can only perform it once however, and the items go from absurdly easy (trash) to borderline impossible
  		 (the captain's sabre). It's a good bonus, but don't rely on it completly!</p>

  <p>The main way you obtain more points is with <b>sacrifices</b>, by bringing a dead crew member to a rune and using the
      <b>"Heartbeat of the Mansus</b> ritual while their body is on said rune. You can't sacrifice everyone, only a few selected
  	   by your god, which will be shown and tracked by using your "Living Heart" ability. These will be:
      <ul>
  			<li>A member of command</li>
  			<li>A member of security</li>
  			<li>A member of your own department</li>
        <li>Two random crewmates</li>
			</ul>  
  			Do note that they can overlap. The member of security could be the HoS, making you have two command members,
  			and the random one could be a member of security, or even the captain himself! Luckly, with a heart of any
  			origin, a piece of paper and a pen you can reroll your targets with the Relentless Heartbeat ritual. This can
  			also be handy if you ran out of targets, or they went into cryosleep.
  			</p>

    <h2 id="Rituals"><b>Rituals</b></h2>
	
		<p> Rituals are the second way of gaining more power; with these, you can generally create powerfull magical
      	gear, as well as some other ones giving different bonuses. to perform a ritual, simply drop the needed
        items over the rune, and click it with your <b>Mansus grasp</b>; if any items are missing, it will tell you,
				which is also the only way to currently have a reminder of what you needed if you forgot after buying one.

</th>
<th style="background-color:green" width="830px">Description
</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of Ash
</th>
<td>Nightwatcher's Secret
</td>
<td>The Path of Ash the Jack of all trades. You get mobility, raw damage power and defense;
  	this is at the con of any robust opponent being able to easily counter you by wearing a fire suit.
  	But as long as they're not wearing one, you'll chew trough them like butter! A good path for
  	beginners, but a powerfull foe nonetheless.
</td></tr>
<tr>
  
<tr>
<th>Path of Flesh
</th>
<td>Principle of Hunger
</td>
<td>The Path of Flesh is the summoner's path. You're not particularly strong in combat and you're very 
    likely to loose a 1v2 even when close to ascending. You outbalance this by creating powerfull player
  	controlled summons and ghoulifing dead bodies (They have to follow you now! If they don't, you're in
  	your right to kill them and ahelp them for not following familiar laws!). Some players also like to
  	play it as a hit-and-run kind, due to having the ability to remove your target's organs, rendering them
  	VERY weak and, in some cases, straight up killing them!
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of Void
</th>
<td>Glimmer of Winter
</td>
<td>The Path of Void focuses on stealth and stuns. While you can certantly hold your ground in combat, picking
  	your targets off one by one is usually the best solution, as your array of spells is capable of stun locking
  	opponents potentially forever, as well as muting them before they can call for help. You also get some of the
  	best mobility in the game, and your attacks pierce through armor! You're also the best path for fighting in spaced
  	areas, forcing your adversaries to wear clunky hardsuits.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of the Blade
</th>
<td>The Cutting Edge
</td>
<td>The Path of the Blade will make you the best at melee combat there is! You completly lack in mobility, but you
  	very much make up for it by being extremly strong in melee combat; as well as reflecting a limited amount of bullets
  	back to the shooter. You're also very unlikely to be stamina crit succesfully, and will gain reduce damage while under
  	half health. This path is fight or die, be ready for a scuffle and become the maints slasher everyone dreams of being.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of Rust
</th>
<td>Blacksmith's Tale
</td>
<td>The Path of Rust grants you the ability to spread rust. You gain very powerful healing and the ability to brute force 
  	your way through most obstacles with it, at the cost of stealth; and as such, it's not reccomended for newer heretics.
  	Rust tiles will weaken others while empowering you, and your grasp can destroy almost every single thing on the station,
    killing ANY silicons and mechs in one hit (Yes, this <b>includes</b> the AI).
</td></tr></tbody></table>

		<h1 id="Heretical_Equipment"><b>Heretical Equipment</b></h1>

  <p> There are plenty of pieces of equipment an heretic can make and will need. They range from powerfull weapons,
    	to potent healing, to one of the best pieces of armor in the entire game; they have one thing in common: you'll
    	have to go on a scavenge hunt for the ingredients! Only the most commonly used one are featured here, but don't
    	be afraid to explore with the rest.
	</p>
		<h2 id="Heretic_Weapons"><b>Heretic Weapons</b></h2>
  <p> The <b>most</b> important piece of
    	equipment you can make is your blade, made differently depending on your path of choice, but always requiring a knife.
    	Don't worry, you can use shivs, made out of cloth from cutting up clothes and glass shards! Only a maximum of two blades
    	(four if you're blade path) can exist simultaniously; if those nasty security officers manage to steal one of yours,
    	you'll have to recall it back using the [PUT NAME] ritual and a chair. You can also "break" your blade by pressing
    	Z while holding it, which will remove it but teleport you on a random position on the station (Carefull! Could very well
      be to the center of the brig, or inside the tesla containment! Use it as a <b>LAST resort</b>!), escaping whoever was after you.
