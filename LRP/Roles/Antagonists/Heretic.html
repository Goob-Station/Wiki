<h2>The <b>Heretic</b></h2>
 
<p>"Forgotten, devoured, gutted. Humanity has forgotten the eldritch forces of decay, but the mansus veil has weakened. We will make them taste fear again..."
  <br>
  Another day, another meaningless shift of working... until you find a higher meaning! The Mansus reaches out to you, and you see the truth in the outer gods. It's now time for you to help them by ascending to demi-godhood... or by refusing ascension and wreacking havok on all the non-belivers that you can get your hands on.</p>

    <h1 id="The_Mansus_Veil_Weakens"><b>The Mansus Veil Weakens</b></h1>

    <p>Now that you've been chosen, you must first understand what these gods are offering for you.
  	The Mansus is a complicated place, and what they kindly gave you already isn't gonna cut it for what you have in mind.
  	Be aware, heretics are one of, if not, the hardest antagonist to master. You will need to be robust both in combat
  	and in general knowledge of the game. That said, don't be afraid to try being one! Trial and error is how the ones
  	that ascend managed to learn it too!</p>
    &nbsp;
    <h2 id="The_Research_Of_Knowledge"><b>The Research Of Knowledge</b></h2>

    <p>The main way of getting power for an heretic is unlocking more rituals and abilities with knowledge points,
  		which can be obtained in plenty of ways, other than a free point every 20 minutes.</p>

  <p>First and foremost, you'll be looking for <b>reality shifts</b> around the station.
      These cannot be seen by non-heretics until harvested, where they become reality fractures.
  	  Once harvested, they will give you one point, or two if done with an open Codex Cicatrix,
      made from a pen, a piece of meat and a book;
      be careful with taking too long making a Codex however, as other heretics can take those fractures before you do!
  		Security isn't allowed to treat fractures as a confirmation of heretic, so don't worry. Your cover is safe.</p>

    <p>Another way is the <b>ritual of knowledge</b>, requiring you four random items from a long list; 
       you'll have to buy it for one point but when done, it will give you five back.
  		 You can only perform it once however, and the items go from absurdly easy (trash) to borderline impossible
  		 (the captain's sabre). It's a good bonus, but don't rely on it completly!</p>

  <p>The main way you obtain more points is with <b>sacrifices</b>, by bringing a dead crew member to a rune and using the
      <b>"Heartbeat of the Mansus</b> ritual while their body is on said rune. You can't sacrifice everyone, only a few selected
  	   by your god, which will be shown and tracked by using your "Living Heart" ability. These will be:
      <ul>
  			<li>A member of command</li>
  			<li>A member of security</li>
  			<li>A member of your own department</li>
        <li>Two random crewmates</li>
			</ul>  
  			Do note that they can overlap. The member of security could be the HoS, making you have two command members,
  			and the random one could be a member of security, or even the captain himself! Luckly, with a heart of any
  			origin, a piece of paper and a pen you can reroll your targets with the Relentless Heartbeat ritual. This can
  			also be handy if you ran out of targets, or they went into cryosleep.
  			</p>

    <h2 id="Rituals"><b>Rituals</b></h2>
	
		<p> Rituals are the second way of gaining more power; with these, you can generally create powerfull magical
      	gear, as well as some other ones giving different bonuses. to perform a ritual, simply drop the needed
        items over the rune, and click it with your <b>Mansus grasp</b>; if any items are missing, it will tell you,
				which is also the only way to currently have a reminder of what you needed if you forgot after buying one.

</th>
<th style="background-color:green" width="830px">Description
</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of Ash
</th>
<td>Nightwatcher's Secret
</td>
<td>The Path of Ash revolves around fire, mobility, and crowd control. It grants multiple tools that are very forgiving for a new Heretic, including a short range jaunt that works while handcuffed and a mask that slowly saps nearby Heathens of sanity and soul, and is highly recommended for first-timers. While its abilities may not be the strongest until later in the round, they are very easy to get the ball rolling with and difficult to stop. Ascending gives you the power to burn down the station in a living tornado of flame.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of Moon
</th>
<td>Moonlight Troupe
</td>
<td>The Path of Moon is... creepy!
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of Lock
</th>
<td>A Steward's Secret
</td>
<td>The Path of Lock grants you incredible area control as well as enough tools to bamboozle those who attempt to reach you. Your weaponry is mainly focused on utility, rather than offense or even defense, despite being able to branch into harmful sidepaths. Lock Heretics are able to quickly disappear and trick chasers with their Eldritch Card, as well as quickly return to safe points across the station. Ascending allows you to turn into empowered eldritch creatures and will open a portal into the Labyrinth's Heart at the side of the ritual, summoning an endless army of eldritch horrors at your service.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of Flesh
</th>
<td>Principle of Hunger
</td>
<td>The Path of Flesh focuses on summoning player-controlled minions and demons to do your bidding. Heretics on this path gain almost no offensive or defensive abilities, and rely heavily on stockpiling corpses and organs to complete rituals. Despite this, it offers many fun and powerful tools to those who can make it to the end, making it a difficult (but satisfying) path overall for inexperienced Heretics. Ascending allows you to shed your human form and become something <i>much</i> greater.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of Void
</th>
<td>Glimmer of Winter
</td>
<td>The Path of Void focuses on stealth, silence and the freezing cold. While the path offers very little utility early on, they quickly gain the ability to silence and freeze their victims, opening the window to silently ambush targets with no other items or chemicals required. It also offers full immunity to freezing temperatures, an invisible armored cloak (with pockets!), and later a targeted blink that damages anything nearby. The path has access to many strong transmuted items, but requires smart use to realize their full potential, making it moderately difficult but a good beginner choice. Ascending silences those around you and makes you the eye of a deadly blizzard.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of the Blade
</th>
<td>The Cutting Edge
</td>
<td>The Path of the Blade empowers you to become master of one-on-one combatant. The path lacks many spells or utility, especially early on, but as you grow in power, your blades gain the ability to counter attack and even dual wield. Blade Heretics can summon orbiting knives that will protect them entirely from any attacks, including stun batons. Additionally, Blade Heretics have a few tools to make getting the jump on your victims easier. Ascending grants you a whirlwind of knives to protect you from all kinds of attacks, as well as greatly enhancing your abilities in combat, especially with your curved blades.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of Rust
</th>
<td>Blacksmith's Tale
</td>
<td>The Path of Rust is about healing, corruption, and brute forcing through all obstacles, at the cost of stealth. Rust grants you the ability to destroy silicons and mechs in one strike, fry any electronics, and demolish any walls or doors. Most of your abilities will create rust - standing over rust grants you healing and resilience. While you will become immensely resistant standing on rusted tiles, you have very little in the way of tools otherwise, making it a moderately difficult path to take. Ascending grants you unparalleled healing and survivability when standing over rust and spreads a tide of rust over the station from your rune.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Path of Cosmos
</th>
<td>Eternal Gate
</td>
<td>The Path of Cosmos allows you to control the area by using cosmic fields. Cosmic fields cannot be entered by people with a star mark. The Cosmic Heretic has several spells throughout the path that give people star marks and generate cosmic fields. The path only contains spells so an amber focus will be useful. This path is complex and requires knowledge of how the path works to realize its full potential. Ascending summons a controllable entity, albeit can require a lot of attention to function optimally.

  <p> There are plenty of pieces of equipment an heretic can make and will need. They range from powerfull weapons,
    	to potent healing, to one of the best pieces of armor in the entire game; they have one thing in common: you'll
    	have to go on a scavenge hunt for the ingredients! Only the most commonly used one are featured here, but don't
    	be afraid to explore with the rest.

  <p> The <b>most</b> important piece of
    	equipment you can make is your blade, made differently depending on your path of choice, but always requiring a knife.
    	Don't worry, you can use shivs, made out of cloth from cutting up clothes and glass shards! Only a maximum of two blades
    	(four if you're blade path) can exist simultaniously; if those nasty security officers manage to steal one of yours,
    	you'll have to recall it back using the [PUT NAME] ritual and a chair. You can also "break" your blade by pressing
    	Z while holding it, which will remove it but teleport you on a random position on the station (Carefull! Could very well
      be to the center of the brig, or inside the tesla containment! Use it as a <b>LAST resort</b>!), escaping whoever was after you.
