<h2>The Head of Security</h2> 
As the leader of the Security department, the Head of Security enforces Space Law and oversees the affairs of all Security personnel, including prosecuting officers who abuse their authority. They have access to most of the station, and by default, they are the only ones who can freely enter the Armory, where specialized equipment is stored, though this can be changed.

<h2>Required Knowledge</h2> 
<p><b>OOC wise</b>: <b>Know the server rules when it comes to playing as a member of Security, ESPECIALLY the HoS.</b>

<p><b>IC wise</b>: 
<p>Space Law, should be exceptionally well known. Standard Operating Procedure should also be well known.
<p>Antagonists It is assumed any HoS has been briefed by Nanotrasen on all their enemies and has perhaps even been present for interrogations and scientific testing.
<p>Advanced combat mechanics is highly advised. You're one of the best-equipped people on the station and maybe the last line of defence.
<p>A wide range of other areas You're responsible for the safety of a big metal death box in space, you'll need to know as much as you can. You may have to advise your officers (and possibly the whole station) on what to do in emergencies, such as the singularity being released, a virus outbreak, or something even stranger. Be able to keep a calm head at all times. If you start to panic, then everyone else will too. You must be trusted and respected; especially if the Captain has fallen and you must replace them.
<p>For Standard Operating Procedure for this role and other security roles, please see Standard Operating Procedure (Security).
<p>For Standard Operating Procedure when processing criminals, please see Legal Operating Procedure.
<h2>Job Description</h2>
<p>You're in charge of the safety and security of the station and crew, not ruling the station with a military clique. Only hunt people down yourself, when it's an urgent matter in one of the many places your officers can't get into, usually you can just sit in your office and let the officers do it for you. You have more access to the station than anyone else in security, but less than the other heads.

<p>You are concerned with the following people; if you are wanting to play this job, <b>you should already be very familiar with their roles</b>:

<p><b>Your Staff</b>

<p>These people report to you and are all of the same rankings. Be polite but stern; if they're being insubordinate/incompetent, tell them to fall in line. If they continue, they should be demoted.

<p>Security Officers: You may want to assign an officer around areas like Medbay and have them get access from the HoP. Make sure they patrol in pairs.
<p>The Warden: They should be staying in the brig, and handing out equipment appropriately. Unless it's an immediate emergency, they'll need your or the Captain's permission to hand out lethal weapons to officers.
<p>The Detective: Also known as a Forensic Technician, their job is to close off crime scenes and investigate evidence and people.
  
<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>The first step towards keeping the station safe is to ensure that your officers aren't a threat. Security enforces the law, but they are not above it - and neither are you. Your personnel should already be familiar with Space Law, Standard Operating Procedure, and standard Security practices. "But what if at the beginning of the shift you find that almost all of them are incompetent or insubordinate?" Well, you're the Head, you'll have to fire them. A bad officer is worse than no officer.

<p>Try to know your officers by name so that you can properly organize and send them on patrols, leads, and follow-ups. A good technique is to do a "location check" every 10 minutes or so. This is when officers respond with their location, giving you a better idea of where your team is and informing you that they're alive and active.

<p>Pay attention to all the radio channels for any calls for help. Your officers will naturally go to them, so tell them to say when they're responding to a call. Additionally, make sure that the Detective collects any relevant evidence. and that the Warden keeps the Security records up-to-date, not in the least because Beepsky can help your officers catch criminals who would otherwise evade them.

<p><b>Delegate, delegate, delegate!</b> Keep track of your staff and coordinate their efforts; you're likely to have a team of 5+ officers and you can't be everywhere at once. The Head of Security shouldn't be in the brig as much as the warden, but generally more than any given officer. Keep your officers patrolling, make sure the warden holds down the brig, and leave the brig to support your officers when major emergencies arise.
  
<p><h3> Laying Down the Law</h3> 
<p>Check to make sure that appropriate times are given out for violations of Space Law, and that your department only arrests people who have committed crimes. Remember, if they're doing something that you don't like but is technically not against the law, you can issue an official injunction - preferably in official-sounding language, signed and stamped - against it. Expect abuse of this power to be called out, however.
  
<h2>El Capitan</h2> 
<p>It is also important that you understand the relationship between Security and the Captain. <b>The Captain's authority on the station is absolute, except where it conflicts with Space Law;</b> the Captain cannot get away with committing crimes, and so on. The only time that Space Law can be overridden is when there is an imminent and overwhelming threat to the station, such as a Code Gamma situation. Other Heads of Staff are required to follow Space Law as well. <b>However</b>, this does not mean that you are the law. You are still outranked by the Captain. You can only arrest the Captain, or other Heads of Staff if they've committed a crime. Until that time, you have to follow orders just like anyone else. It is highly advised to contact CentCom for confirmation if arresting the Captain.
  
<h2>Your Personal Room</h2>
<p>Your personal quarters is in the Brig. You can find your locker, and hardsuit storage there. Your office also has both a security records computer and a security camera console which you can use to monitor the station from the comfort of your desk chair.
  
<h2>The Brig</h2>
<p>The holding area for prisoners. Only people with access to security can enter. It's still possible for normal crew members to view the cells through the windows behind them.

<p>The brig also has blast doors in all of the windows, as well as the halls into the cells. There's a button to drop them in the warden's office and your office.

<p>Prisoners may try to flee, so do something about the doors (portable flasher), or handcuff them to the bed as you investigate their items (make sure to then release from the bed and cuffs if they aren't dangerous). Ensure to <b>SET A TIME TO THE TIMER</b> (It helps to avoid confusion or later problems!). Make sure to keep the time to the crime.

<p>If a prisoner has been deemed too dangerous to release or received a sentence that meets the requirement for perma, they can be kept in the permabrig area.
