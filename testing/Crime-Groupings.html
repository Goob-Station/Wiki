	<h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Harm and Cruelty (A)</h1>
  
  <p>Animal Harm and Animal Cruelty are two different crimes specifying the abuse/harm to station animals and personal pets. </p>
  <p>- This does not extend to pests that live on the station, such as mothroaches, mice, rats, lootbugs, and more. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Harm</h2>
  <p>Animal harm is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that does not result in it going into a critical state. </p>
  <p>- A minor punch or so isn't worth charging over, an infraction warning being sufficient, but harming more than just a punch is worth investigating. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Cruelty</h2>
  <p>Animal cruelty is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that results in it going into a critical state and/or dying. </p>
  <p>- Animal Cruelty is worth investigating for other crimes when the animal and/or pet dies, for potential other grievances between the offender and victim. </p>

  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Assault and Manslaughter (V)</h1>
  
  <p>Assault ranges from a simple Disturbance all the way to Manslaughter, Murder, and Prime/Mass Murder. </p>
  <p>The <b style="color=red;"> primary difference</b> is to the degree of the assault/murder, and how it happened. </p>
