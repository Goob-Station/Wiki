	<h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Harm and Cruelty (A)</h1>
  
  <p>Animal Harm and Animal Cruelty are two different crimes specifying the abuse/harm to station animals and personal pets. </p>
  <p>- This does not extend to pests that live on the station, such as mothroaches, mice, rats, lootbugs, and more. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Harm</h2>
  <p>Animal harm is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that does not result in it going into a critical state. </p>
  <p>- A minor punch or so isn't worth charging over, an infraction warning being sufficient, but harming more than just a punch is worth investigating. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Cruelty</h2>
  <p>Animal cruelty is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that results in it going into a critical state and/or dying. </p>
  <p>- Animal Cruelty is worth investigating for other crimes when the animal and/or pet dies, for potential other grievances between the offender and victim. </p>

  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Assault and Manslaughter (V)</h1>
  
  <p>Assault ranges from a simple Disturbance all the way to Manslaughter, Murder, and Prime/Mass Murder. </p>
  <p>The <b> primary difference </b> is to the degree of the assault/murder, and how it happened. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Disturbance and Assault</h2>
  <p> Simple scuffles, causing problems for others, harassing, and the likes can boil down to a <b>Disturbance</b> and should be warned. </p>
  <p> If there is a hands-on moment and people get injured or hurt, but only minor wounds that are easily taken care of, this would be <b>Assault</b>. </p>
  <p>- The difference between a Disturbance and an Assault charge is whether it was hands-on or not, and whether violence happened. </p>
  <p>- Disturbances: The catch-all for obnoxious crewmates. </p>
  <p>Covers things such as public nudity, needless insults, obstructing authorities, and inciting crime or violence. </p>
  <p>Generally covers things that aren't explicitly illegal. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Aggravated Assault</h2>
  <p>The difference between Assault and Aggravated Assault is the intent to grievously harm to the point nearing (or achieving) a critical state of injury. </p>
  <p>- To take physical action against a person with intent to grievously harm, but not to kill. Assaulting someone to the point of them critting or intending to achieve that. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Manslaughter and Murder</h2>
  <p>The difference between Manslaughter and Murder is intent. Did the individual accidentally kill someone (such as crossfire) or did they kill them with the intent to take their life? </p>
  <p>- Manslaughter: To unintentionally kill someone through negligent, but not malicious, actions. Murder would be purposefully ending someone's life. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Prime/Mass Murder</h2>
  <p>Prime/Mass Murder is an encompassing charge for two separate cases. If the suspect has killed three (3) or more individuals, then it is considered <b>Mass Murder</b> </p>
  <p>However, if the suspect has killed even one person and then gone through lengths of dismembering and/or have gone through steps of preventing their revival, it would be <b>Prime Murder</b> . </p>
  <p>- Prime Murder: To commit the act of murder, with clear intent to kill, and clear intent or to have materially take steps to prevent the revival of the victim. </p>
  <p>- Mass Murder: To commit multiple murders en masse, targeting three (3) or more people. </p>
