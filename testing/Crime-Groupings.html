	<h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Harm and Cruelty (A)</h1>
  
  <p>Animal Harm and Animal Cruelty are two different crimes specifying the abuse/harm to station animals and personal pets. </p>
  
  <p>- This does not extend to pests that live on the station, such as mothroaches, mice, rats, lootbugs, and more. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Harm</h2>
  
  <p>Animal harm is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that does not result in it going into a critical state. </p>
  
  <p>- A minor punch or so isn't worth charging over, an infraction warning being sufficient, but harming more than just a punch is worth investigating. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Cruelty</h2>
  
  <p>Animal cruelty is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that results in it going into a critical state and/or dying. </p>
  
  <p>- Animal Cruelty is worth investigating for other crimes when the animal and/or pet dies, for potential other grievances between the offender and victim. </p>

  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Assault and Manslaughter (V)</h1>
  
  <p>Assault ranges from a simple Disturbance all the way to Manslaughter, Murder, and Prime/Mass Murder. </p>
  
  <p>The <b> primary difference </b> is to the degree of the assault/murder, and how it happened. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Disturbance and Assault</h2>
  
  <p> Simple scuffles, causing problems for others, harassing, and the likes can boil down to a <b>Disturbance</b> and should be warned. </p>
  
  <p> If there is a hands-on moment and people get injured or hurt, but only minor wounds that are easily taken care of, this would be <b>Assault</b>. </p>
  
  <p>- The difference between a Disturbance and an Assault charge is whether it was hands-on or not, and whether violence happened. </p>
  
  <p>- Disturbances: The catch-all for obnoxious crewmates. </p>
  
  <p>Covers things such as public nudity, needless insults, obstructing authorities, and inciting crime or violence. </p>
  
  <p>Generally covers things that aren't explicitly illegal. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Aggravated Assault</h2>
  
  <p>The difference between Assault and Aggravated Assault is the intent to grievously harm to the point nearing (or achieving) a critical state of injury. </p>
  
  <p>- To take physical action against a person with intent to grievously harm, but not to kill. Assaulting someone to the point of them critting or intending to achieve that. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Manslaughter and Murder</h2>
  
  <p>The difference between Manslaughter and Murder is intent. Did the individual accidentally kill someone (such as crossfire) or did they kill them with the intent to take their life? </p>
  
  <p>- Manslaughter: To unintentionally kill someone through negligent, but not malicious, actions. Murder would be purposefully ending someone's life. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Prime/Mass Murder</h2>
  
  <p>Prime/Mass Murder is an encompassing charge for two separate cases. If the suspect has killed three (3) or more individuals, then it is considered <b>Mass Murder</b> </p>
  
  <p>However, if the suspect has killed even one person and then gone through lengths of dismembering and/or have gone through steps of preventing their revival, it would be <b>Prime Murder</b> . </p>
  
  <p>- Prime Murder: To commit the act of murder, with clear intent to kill, and clear intent or to have materially take steps to prevent the revival of the victim. </p>
  
  <p>- Mass Murder: To commit multiple murders en masse, targeting three (3) or more people. </p>
  
  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Contraband Possession (C)</h1>
  <p>Contraband Possession comes in a variety of forms and tiers of severity. These are outlined in more detail below. </p>
  
  <p>- Contraband comes in many forms, but is generalized as items, equipment, and/or materials that are not approved for use on NanoTrasen Stations. </p>
  
  <p>These items include, but are not limited to: Items produced by Syndicate, The Wizard, Cultist Nature, Heretics, Changelings, Nuclear Operatives, and more. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Contraband, Minor</h2>
  <p>Minor Contraband extends to items that do not put much threat to life, such as implanting devices, syndicate drugs, non-lethal magical books, and more. </p>
  
  <p>- This includes equipment that would not normally be accessible by any crew on the station, including equipment that is not normally accessible to crew members that are not in Security/Command (such as having armor and combat globes or jackboots as a non-Security personnel). </p>
  
  <p>- Items classified as minor contraband are not lethal and cannot be used for lethal purposes. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Contraband, Major</h2>
  <p>Major Contraband extends to items that can put threat to life, cause station damage (en masse), such as weapons, advanced armors/hardsuits, explosions, and more. </p>
  
  <p>- This includes equipment that poses a threat to life on the station and would not normally be accessible to anyone on the station except Security/Command. </p>
  
  <p>Station personnel possessing equipment normally found in the Armory/Vault that has lethal capabilities or powerful technology (such as Lecters and Riot Suits) would be considered Major Contraband as regular Station Personnel do not have access to these. </p>
  <p>- Anything related to Nuclear Operatives would also be considered Major Contraband. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Contraband, Corporate</h2>
  <p>Corporate Contraband is contraband explicitly relating to corporate secrets, such as blackboxes and the likes. This is contraband that is considered property of NanoTrasen and/or other Corporations that work with NanoTrasen, such as company secrets that can be retrieved from damaged stations or ruins. </p>
  <p>- Corporate Contraband explicitly refers to: To possess secret documentation or high density tamper-resistant data storage devices (Blackboxes) from any organization without authorization by Nanotrasen. </p>
  <p>- Anything else related to this charge is explicitly materials such as <b> Nuclear Fission Devices </b> and <b> Nuclear Authorization Disks </b> for such devices. </p>
  
  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Disruption and Disturbances (X)</h1>
  
  <p>Disruptions and Disturbances of Peace relate to matters concerning blatant misuse of Communications and organization of movements to disrupt normal operations of a department, not related to Rioting. </p>
  
  <p>There are several differences between these two, but they are classified under Disruptions in general for easier convenience of charges and escalation when there are minor changes. Disruptive Communications can easily lead to Distrubances of Peace.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Disruptive Communications (Disruption)</h2>
  
  <p>Disruptive Communications boils down to simple misuse of Communications Channels in Department or Common. This can be affiliated with spamming unnecessary information or repetitive words into the Communications Channel, to using Communications Channels for unnecessary chatter not necessary for the respective channel. </p>
  
  <p>- Some examples could pertain to spamming the channels. Others would be conversations that could be done so locally or in-private over a communications channel that doesn't pertain to the conversation or scenario. </p>
  
  <p>- This is a liberally taken and decisive charge to apply to someone, so it is classified as an infraction and should be warned before prosecuting such charges.
 </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Disturbance of Peace</h2>
  
  <p>The Disturbance of Peace charge is a minor form of organization that does not become violent like Rioting, hence the Minor Severity of the charge. </p>
  
  <p>- To knowingly organize a movement which disrupts the normal operations of a department, or being a public disturbance. </p>
