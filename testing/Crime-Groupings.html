	<h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Harm and Cruelty (A)</h1>
  
  <p>Animal Harm and Animal Cruelty are two different crimes specifying the abuse/harm to station animals and personal pets. </p>
  
  <p>- This does not extend to pests that live on the station, such as mothroaches, mice, rats, lootbugs, and more. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Harm</h2>
  
  <p>Animal harm is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that does not result in it going into a critical state. </p>
  
  <p>- A minor punch or so isn't worth charging over, an infraction warning being sufficient, but harming more than just a punch is worth investigating. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Animal Cruelty</h2>
  
  <p>Animal cruelty is the intentional (or unintentional) harm of a station animal or personal pet that results in it going into a critical state and/or dying. </p>
  
  <p>- Animal Cruelty is worth investigating for other crimes when the animal and/or pet dies, for potential other grievances between the offender and victim. </p>

  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Assault and Manslaughter (V)</h1>
  
  <p>Assault ranges from a simple Disturbance all the way to Manslaughter, Murder, and Prime/Mass Murder. </p>
  
  <p>The <b> primary difference </b> is to the degree of the assault/murder, and how it happened. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Disturbance and Assault</h2>
  
  <p> Simple scuffles, causing problems for others, harassing, and the likes can boil down to a <b>Disturbance</b> and should be warned. </p>
  
  <p> If there is a hands-on moment and people get injured or hurt, but only minor wounds that are easily taken care of, this would be <b>Assault</b>. </p>
  
  <p>- The difference between a Disturbance and an Assault charge is whether it was hands-on or not, and whether violence happened. </p>
  
  <p>- Disturbances: The catch-all for obnoxious crewmates. </p>
  
  <p>Covers things such as public nudity, needless insults, obstructing authorities, and inciting crime or violence. </p>
  
  <p>Generally covers things that aren't explicitly illegal. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Aggravated Assault</h2>
  
  <p>The difference between Assault and Aggravated Assault is the intent to grievously harm to the point nearing (or achieving) a critical state of injury. </p>
  
  <p>- To take physical action against a person with intent to grievously harm, but not to kill. Assaulting someone to the point of them critting or intending to achieve that. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Manslaughter and Murder</h2>
  
  <p>The difference between Manslaughter and Murder is intent. Did the individual accidentally kill someone (such as crossfire) or did they kill them with the intent to take their life? </p>
  
  <p>- Manslaughter: To unintentionally kill someone through negligent, but not malicious, actions. Murder would be purposefully ending someone's life. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Prime/Mass Murder</h2>
  
  <p>Prime/Mass Murder is an encompassing charge for two separate cases. If the suspect has killed three (3) or more individuals, then it is considered <b>Mass Murder</b> </p>
  
  <p>However, if the suspect has killed even one person and then gone through lengths of dismembering and/or have gone through steps of preventing their revival, it would be <b>Prime Murder</b> . </p>
  
  <p>- Prime Murder: To commit the act of murder, with clear intent to kill, and clear intent or to have materially take steps to prevent the revival of the victim. </p>
  
  <p>- Mass Murder: To commit multiple murders en masse, targeting three (3) or more people. </p>
  
  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Contraband Possession (C)</h1>
  <p>Contraband Possession comes in a variety of forms and tiers of severity. These are outlined in more detail below. </p>
  
  <p>- Contraband comes in many forms, but is generalized as items, equipment, and/or materials that are not approved for use on NanoTrasen Stations. </p>
  
  <p>These items include, but are not limited to: Items produced by Syndicate, The Wizard, Cultist Nature, Heretics, Changelings, Nuclear Operatives, and more. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Contraband, Minor</h2>
  <p>Minor Contraband extends to items that do not put much threat to life, such as implanting devices, syndicate drugs, non-lethal magical books, and more. </p>
  
  <p>- This includes equipment that would not normally be accessible by any crew on the station, including equipment that is not normally accessible to crew members that are not in Security/Command (such as having armor and combat globes or jackboots as a non-Security personnel). </p>
  
  <p>- Items classified as minor contraband are not lethal and cannot be used for lethal purposes. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Contraband, Major</h2>
  <p>Major Contraband extends to items that can put threat to life, cause station damage (en masse), such as weapons, advanced armors/hardsuits, explosions, and more. </p>
  
  <p>- This includes equipment that poses a threat to life on the station and would not normally be accessible to anyone on the station except Security/Command. </p>
  
  <p>Station personnel possessing equipment normally found in the Armory/Vault that has lethal capabilities or powerful technology (such as Lecters and Riot Suits) would be considered Major Contraband as regular Station Personnel do not have access to these. </p>
  <p>- Anything related to Nuclear Operatives would also be considered Major Contraband. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Contraband, Corporate</h2>
  <p>Corporate Contraband is contraband explicitly relating to corporate secrets, such as blackboxes and the likes. This is contraband that is considered property of NanoTrasen and/or other Corporations that work with NanoTrasen, such as company secrets that can be retrieved from damaged stations or ruins. </p>
  <p>- Corporate Contraband explicitly refers to: To possess secret documentation or high density tamper-resistant data storage devices (Blackboxes) from any organization without authorization by Nanotrasen. </p>
  <p>- Anything else related to this charge is explicitly materials such as <b> Nuclear Fission Devices </b> and <b> Nuclear Authorization Disks </b> for such devices. </p>
  
  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Disruption and Disturbances (X)</h1>
  
  <p>Disruptions and Disturbances of Peace relate to matters concerning blatant misuse of Communications and organization of movements to disrupt normal operations of a department, not related to Rioting. </p>
  
  <p>There are several differences between these two, but they are classified under Disruptions in general for easier convenience of charges and escalation when there are minor changes. Disruptive Communications can easily lead to Distrubances of Peace.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Disruptive Communications (Disruption)</h2>
  
  <p>Disruptive Communications boils down to simple misuse of Communications Channels in Department or Common. This can be affiliated with spamming unnecessary information or repetitive words into the Communications Channel, to using Communications Channels for unnecessary chatter not necessary for the respective channel. </p>
  
  <p>- Some examples could pertain to spamming the channels. Others would be conversations that could be done so locally or in-private over a communications channel that doesn't pertain to the conversation or scenario. </p>
  
  <p>- This is a liberally taken and decisive charge to apply to someone, so it is classified as an infraction and should be warned before prosecuting such charges.
 </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Disturbance of Peace</h2>
  
  <p>The Disturbance of Peace charge is a minor form of organization that does not become violent like Rioting, hence the Minor Severity of the charge. </p>
  
  <p>- To knowingly organize a movement which disrupts the normal operations of a department, or being a public disturbance. </p>
  
  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Drug Possession and Distribution (D)</h1>
  
  <p>Drug Possession and Drug Distribution are two separate crimes that cannot be stackable. If the offender is distributing drugs, they take the higher severity offense, Drug Distribution. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Drug Possession</h2>
  
  <p>Drug Possession is specifically the carrying of chemicals, substances, and/or any other drug-like entity in large quantities. </p>
  
  <p>- To make, hold, or abuse restricted drugs or chemicals. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Illegal Distribution (Drugs)</h2>
  
  <p>Illegal Distribution is the distribution of a large quantity of drugs that are considered narcotics or do not serve a purpose outside of the medical bay or medicinal purposes. These can and should extend to drugs that are considered contrband as well. </p>
  
  <p>For further processing, this extends to willingly giving out drugs or equipment that can produce drugs in large quantities. </p>
  
  <p>- This does not extend to a few pills or the likes that can be used recreationally. The exception being if the "recreational" use is violent in nature or harmful to crewmembers. </p>
  
  <p>- The possession of dangerous or illegal drugs/equipment in a quantity greater than that which is reasonable for personal consumption. </p>
  
  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Hostile Agents (H)</h1>
  
  <p>Hostile Agents extends to any antagonistic individuals or teams of individuals that pose a threat to the station and/or NanoTrasen as a corporation. </p>
  
  <p>These individuals come in a variety of severity as do the charges, so you should follow this section for a more efficient understanding of sentencing. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Hostile Agent</h2>
  
  <p>Hostile Agents are confirmed individuals with alliances to another organization working against the Station and/or NanoTrasen. </p>
    
  <p>This includes traitors and thieves that are working to undermine the efforts of NanoTrasen and its personnel aboard this station. </p>
  
  <p>These individuals must not have committed egregious crimes, such as murdering or sabotaging en masse to be charged with this. If they have performed such crimes, they should be charged with Hostile Activity instead. </p>
  
  <p>- Syndicate Traitors and Thieves should be charged with this if they have not committed other crimes that have resulted in deaths and/or lack of functionality for certain jobs/departments. </p>
  
  <p>- This also extends to attempting to recruit others, as such: To knowingly act as a recruiter, representative, messenger, ally, benefactor, or other associate of an enemy corporation. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Hostile Activity</h2>
  
  <p>To be a Hostile Agent (or station personnel, in some cases) that is committing massive dangers to the station; whether it be station sabotage, murders, mass theft, and/or more, this is generally the charge that is associated with such cases. </p>
    
  <p>This can also extend to any personnel that impede Security's intent to apprehend a criminal, walling off a critical area (such as vault, medbay, bridge, et cetera) and more activity that would be a major flaw to the Station. </p>
  
  <p>- Hostile Activity should be charged to enemies of the station that have been confirmed to have committed several crimes against the station, alongside their objectives to do such crimes. </p>
  
  <p>- This is not exclusively limited to Hostile Agents, but should be the next charge for Hostile Agents that fall into this category. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Enemy of the Station</h2>
  
  <p>Enemy of the Station is a large charge and a very severe one to inflict on someone. You should think about their stance against NanoTrasen and the Station prior to issuing a charge like this on any personnel. </p>
    
  <p>This is effectively listing them as a guaranteed threat that should be eliminated, whether it be by permanent brigging with supervision or execution. </p>
  
  <p>An "Enemy of the Station" must be powerful enough to be a massive threat to the station. While Syndicate Traitors are not classified as such, they are <b> not exempt </b> from this charge if they acquire enough power to be considered a massive station threat (such as an individual with DAGD). </p>
  
  <p>Anyone labeled an "Enemy of the Station" must be tried in court for permanent brigging with the ability to defend themselves, if apprehended without lethal takedown or posing an active threat. </p>
  
  <p>- To be a member of any of the following organizations clearly conspiring for the destruction of station or mass damage to its personnel like Nuclear Operatives, Wizards, Space Pirates, Heretics, Cultists, Changelings, et cetera.
 </p>
  
  <h1 style="color: #127bb7;">Negligence (N)</h1>
  
  <p>Negligence comes in many levels of severity and can even extend to the death or mass death of the station for how it is classified.  These are explained further below. </p>
  
   <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Negligence, Minor and Major</h2>
  
  <p>The difference between Minor Negligence and Major Negligence is the level of threat it has imposed on someone or several people.  This is primarily how affected an individual was by the negligence. </p>
  
  <p>Did it leave someone severely hurt (but not crit)? Then it would be Major Negligence. </p>
  
  <p>If it only harmed and was easily corrected, not leaving someone severely wounded but also potentially having gone that far?  Then it would only be Minor Negligence. </p>
  
  <p>- Major Negligence is classified as: To be negligent in one's duty to an extent that it may cause harm to multiple individuals, a department, or in a manor which directly leads to a serious injury of another person which requires emergency medical treatment. </p>
  
  <p>Some more notes are shown below, for a breakup of how Negligence can, and should, be classified. </p>
  
  <p>- Minor Negligence would be something like: This is the charge for the doctor that accidentally pumps pentetic acid into an oozeling, or a scientist who accidentally floods toxins with room temperature CO2 or N2O. </p>
  
  <p>- An Atmospheric Technician messing up the airlock and releasing a burn chamber into the TEG wouldn't be Major until it killed and harmed others before being corrected. </p>
  
   <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Dereliction</h2>
  
  <p>Dereliction is the willfull abandonment of a position or job that causes a danger to be present, such as an Atmospheric Technician leaving ignoring the use of a holofan and letting a plasma flood spread into a hallway and refusing to fix the issue. </p>
  
  <p>- Dereliction is specifically classified as: To willfully abandon an obligation that is critical to the station's continued operation. </p>
  
   <h2 style="color: #127bb7;">Manslaughter and Biological Terror</h2>
  
  <p>Manslaughter and Biological Terror are linked to negligence causing full death or mass death to a station. Biological Terror primarily focuses on the releasing of a reagent that causes a virus to spread that's harmful to the station. </p>
  
  <p>- Manslaughter is the same as listed in Assault: To unintentionally kill someone through negligent, but not malicious, actions. </p>
  
  <p>- Biological Terror is: To knowingly release, cause, or otherwise cause the station to become affected by a disease, plant, r ther biological form which may spread unconstrained and or cause serious physical harm. </p>
